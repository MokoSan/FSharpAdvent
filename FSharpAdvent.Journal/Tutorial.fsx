Welcome to FsLab journal
========================

FsLab journal is a simple Visual Studio template that makes it easy to do
interactive data analysis using F# Interactive and produce nice HTML or PDF
to document you research.

Next steps
----------

 * To learn more about FsLab Journal, go to "Solution Explorer", right click
   on your newly created project, select "Add", "New item.." and choose
   "FsLab Walkthrough" (if you do not have R statistics environment installed)
   or "FsLab Walkthrough with R" (if you do have R).

 * To add new experiments to your project, got to "Add", "New item" and choose
   new "FsLab Experiment". You can have multiple scripts in a single project.

 * To see how things work, hit **F5** and see how FsLab Journal turns this
   Markdown document with simple F# script into a nice report!

 * To generate PDF from your experiments, you need to install `pdflatex` and
   have it accessible in the system `PATH` variable. Then you can run
   `build pdf` in the folder with this script (then check out `output` folder).

Sample experiment
-----------------

We start by referencing `Deedle` and `FSharp.Charting` libraries and then we
load the contents of *this* file:
*)

(*** define-output:loading ***)
open Deedle
open System.IO
open XPlot.GoogleCharts
open XPlot.GoogleCharts.Deedle

let file = __SOURCE_DIRECTORY__ + "/Tutorial.fsx"
let contents = File.ReadAllText(file)
printfn "Loaded '%s' of length %d" file contents.Length
(*** include-output:loading ***)

(**
Now, we split the contents of the file into words, count the frequency of
words longer than 3 letters and turn the result into a Deedle series:
*)
let words =
  contents.Split(' ', '"', '\n', '\r', '*')
  |> Array.filter (fun s -> s.Length > 3)
  |> Array.map (fun s -> s.ToLower())
  |> Seq.countBy id
  |> series
(**
Finally, let's build a chart showing the top 6 words occurring in this tutorial:
*)

(*** define-output:chart ***)
words
|> Series.sort
|> Series.rev
|> Series.take 6
|> Chart.Column
(*** include-it:chart ***)
