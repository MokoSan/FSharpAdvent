    "ChapterData": "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms \r\nand an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a \r\nhobbit-hole, and that means comfort. \r\n\r\nIt had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the \r\nexact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel \r\nwithout smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and \r\nlots and lots of pegs for hats and coats — the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, \r\ngoing fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill — The Hill, as all the people for many miles \r\nround called it — and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. No \r\ngoing upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had \r\nwhole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on \r\nthe same passage. The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (going in), for these were the only \r\nones to have windows, deep-set round windows looking over his garden, and meadows beyond, sloping \r\ndown to the river. \r\n\r\nThis hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins. The Bagginses had lived in \r\nthe neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people considered them very respectable, not \r\nonly because most of them were rich, but also because they never had any adventures or did anything \r\nunexpected: you could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking \r\nhim. This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, and found himself doing and saying things \r\naltogether unexpected. He may have lost the neighbours’ respect, but he gained — well, you will see \r\nwhether he gained anything in the end. \r\n\r\nThe mother of our particular hobbit — what is a hobbit? I suppose hobbits need some description \r\nnowadays, since they have become rare and shy of the Big People, as they call us. They are (or were) a \r\nlittle people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded Dwarves. Hobbits have no beards. \r\nThere is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to \r\ndisappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making \r\na noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off. They are inclined to be fat in the stomach; they \r\ndress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); wear no shoes, because their feet grow natural \r\nleathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long \r\nclever brown fingers, good-natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which \r\nthey have twice a day when they can get it). Now you know enough to go on with. As I was saying, the \r\nmother of this hobbit — of Bilbo Baggins, that is — was the famous Belladonna Took, one of the three \r\nremarkable daughters of the Old Took, head of the hobbits who lived across The Water, the small river \r\nthat ran at the foot of The Hill. It was often said (in other families) that long ago one of the Took \r\nancestors must have taken a fairy wife. That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was still \r\nsomething not entirely hobbitlike about them, and once in a while members of the Took-clan would go \r\nand have adventures. They discreetly disappeared, and the family hushed it up; but the fact remained \r\n\r\n\r\nthat the Tooks were not as respectable as the Bagginses, though they were undoubtedly richer. \r\n\r\nNot that Belladonna Took ever had any adventures after she became Mrs. Bungo Baggins. Bungo, \r\nthat was Bilbo’s father, built the most luxurious hobbit-hole for her (and partly with her money) that \r\nwas to be found either under The Hill or over The Hill or across The Water, and there they remained to \r\nthe end of their days. Still it is probable that Bilbo, her only son, although he looked and behaved \r\nexactly like a second edition of his solid and comfortable father, got something a bit queer in his \r\nmake-up from the Took side, something that only waited for a chance to come out. The chance never \r\narrived, until Bilbo Baggins was grown up, being about fifty years old or so, and living in the beautiful \r\nhobbit-hole built by his father, which I have just described for you, until he had in fact apparently \r\nsettled down immovably. \r\n\r\nBy some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when there was less noise \r\nand more green, and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous, and Bilbo Baggins was standing \r\nat his door after breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down to his \r\nwoolly toes (neatly brushed) — Gandalf came by. Gandalf ! If you had heard only a quarter of what I \r\nhave heard about him, and I have only heard very little of all there is to hear, you would be prepared \r\nfor any sort of remarkable tale. Tales and adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he went, \r\nin the most extraordinary fashion. He had not been down that way under The Hill for ages and ages, \r\nnot since his friend the Old Took died, in fact, and the hobbits had almost forgotten what he looked \r\nlike. He had been away over The Hill and across The Water on businesses of his own since they were \r\nall small hobbit-boys and hobbit-girls. \r\n\r\nAll that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed \r\nblue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which his long white beard hung down below his waist, \r\nand immense black boots. \r\n\r\n“Good Morning!” said Bilbo, and he meant it. The sun was shining, and the grass was very green. \r\nBut Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of his \r\nshady hat. \r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” he said. “Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning \r\nwhether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on?” \r\n\r\n“All of them at once,” said Bilbo. “And a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors, into \r\nthe bargain. If you have a pipe about you, sit down and have a fill of mine! There’s no hurry, we have \r\nall the day before us!” Then Bilbo sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs, and blew out a \r\nbeautiful grey ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking and floated away over The \r\nHill. \r\n\r\n“Very pretty!” said Gandalf. “But I have no time to blow smoke-rings this morning. I am looking \r\nfor someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging, and it’s very difficult to find anyone.” \r\n\r\n“I should think so — in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty \r\ndisturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner! I can’t think what anybody sees in them,” \r\nsaid our Mr. Baggins, and stuck one thumb behind his braces, and blew out another even bigger \r\nsmokering. Then he took out his morning letters, and began to read, pretending to take no more notice \r\nof the old man. He had decided that he was not quite his sort, and wanted him to go away. But the old \r\nman did not move. He stood leaning on his stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything, till \r\nBilbo got quite uncomfortable and even a little cross. \r\n\r\n“Good morning!” he said at last. “We don’t want any adventures here, thank you! You might try \r\nover The Hill or across The Water.” By this he meant that the conversation was at an end. \r\n\r\n“What a lot of things you do use Good morning for!” said Gandalf. “Now you mean that you want \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto get rid of me, and that it won’t be good till I move off.” \r\n\r\n“Not at all, not at all, my dear sir! Let me see, I don’t think I know your name?” \r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, my dear sir — and I do know your name, Mr. Bilbo Baggins. And you do know my name, \r\nthough you don’t remember that I belong to it. I am Gandalf, and Gandalf means me! To think that I \r\nshould have lived to be good-morninged by Belladonna Took’s son, as if I was selling buttons at the \r\ndoor!” \r\n\r\n“Gandalf, Gandalf! Good gracious me! Not the wandering wizard that gave Old Took a pair of \r\nmagic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came undone till ordered? Not the fellow \r\nwho used to tell such wonderful tales at parties, about dragons and goblins and giants and the rescue of \r\nprincesses and the unexpected luck of widows’ sons? Not the man that used to make such particularly \r\nexcellent fireworks! I remember those! Old Took used to have them on Midsummer’s Eve. Splendid! \r\nThey used to go up like great lilies and snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all \r\nevening!” You will notice already that Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe, also \r\nthat he was very fond of flowers. “Dear me!” he went on. “Not the Gandalf who was responsible for so \r\nmany quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures? Anything from climbing trees \r\nto visiting elves — or sailing in ships, sailing to other shores! Bless me, life used to be quite inter — I \r\nmean, you used to upset things badly in these parts once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no \r\nidea you were still in business.” \r\n\r\n“Where else should I be?” said the wizard. “All the same I am pleased to find you remember \r\nsomething about me. You seem to remember my fireworks kindly, at any rate, and that is not without \r\nhope. Indeed for your old grandfather Took’s sake, and for the sake of poor Belladonna, I will give \r\nyou what you asked for.” \r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, I haven’t asked for anything!” \r\n\r\n“Yes, you have! Twice now. My pardon. I give it you. In fact I will go so far as to send you on this \r\nadventure. Very amusing for me, very good for you — and profitable too, very likely, if you ever get \r\nover it.” \r\n\r\n“Sorry! I don’t want any adventures, thank you. Not today. Good morning! But please come to tea \r\n— any time you like! Why not tomorrow? Come tomorrow! Good bye!” With that the hobbit turned \r\nand scuttled inside his round green door, and shut it as quickly as he dared, not to seem rude. Wizards \r\nafter all are wizards. \r\n\r\n“What on earth did I ask him to tea for!” he said to himself, as he went to the pantry. He had only \r\njust had breakfast, but he thought a cake or two and a drink of something would do him good after his \r\nfright. \r\n\r\nGandalf in the meantime was still standing outside the door, and laughing long but quietly. After a \r\nwhile he stepped up, and with the spike on his staff scratched a queer sign on the hobbit’s beautiful \r\ngreen front-door. Then he strode away, just about the time when Bilbo was finishing his second cake \r\nand beginning to think that he had escaped adventures very well. \r\n\r\nThe next day he had almost forgotten about Gandalf. He did not remember things very well, unless \r\nhe put them down on his Engagement Tablet: like this: Gandalf Tea Wednesday. Yesterday he had \r\nbeen too flustered to do anything of the kind. \r\n\r\nJust before tea-time there came a tremendous ring on the front-door bell, and then he remembered! \r\nHe rushed and put on the kettle, and put out another cup and saucer, and an extra cake or two, and ran \r\nto the door. \r\n\r\n“I am so sorry to keep you waiting!” he was going to say, when he saw that it was not Gandalf at \r\nall. It was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden belt, and very bright eyes under his dark- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreen hood. As soon as the door was opened, he pushed inside, just as if he had been expected. \r\n\r\nHe hung his hooded cloak on the nearest peg, and “Dwalin at your service!” he said with a low \r\nbow. \r\n\r\n“Bilbo Baggins at yours!” said the hobbit, too surprised to ask any questions for the moment. When \r\nthe silence that followed had become uncomfortable, he added: “I am just about to take tea; pray come \r\nand have some with me.” A little stiff perhaps, but he meant it kindly. And what would you do, if an \r\nuninvited dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall without a word of explanation? \r\n\r\nThey had not been at table long, in fact they had hardly reached the third cake, when there came \r\nanother even louder ring at the bell. \r\n\r\n“Excuse me!” said the hobbit, and off he went to the door. \r\n\r\n“So you have got here at last!” That was what he was going to say to Gandalf this time. But it was \r\nnot Gandalf. Instead there was a very old-looking dwarf on the step with a white beard and a scarlet \r\nhood; and he too hopped inside as soon as the door was open, just as if he had been invited. \r\n\r\n“I see they have begun to arrive already,” he said when he caught sight of Dwalin’ s green hood \r\nhanging up. He hung his red one next to it, and “Balin at your service!” he said with his hand on his \r\nbreast. \r\n\r\n“Thank you!” said Bilbo with a gasp. It was not the correct thing to say, but they have begun to \r\narrive had flustered him badly. He liked visitors, but he liked to know them before they arrived, and \r\nhe preferred to ask them himself. He had a horrible thought that the cakes might run short, and then he \r\n— as the host: he knew his duty and stuck to it however painful — he might have to go without. \r\n\r\n“Come along in, and have some tea!” he managed to say after taking a deep breath. \r\n\r\n“A little beer would suit me better, if it is all the same to you, my good sir,” said Balin with the \r\nwhite beard. “But I don’t mind some cake — seed-cake, if you have any.” \r\n\r\n“Lots!” Bilbo found himself answering, to his own surprise; and he found himself scuttling off, \r\ntoo, to the cellar to fill a pint beer-mug, and then to a pantry to fetch two beautiful round seed-cakes \r\nwhich he had baked that afternoon for his after-supper morsel. \r\n\r\nWhen he got back Balin and Dwalin were talking at the table like old friends (as a matter of fact \r\nthey were brothers). Bilbo plumped down the beer and the cake in front of them, when loud came a \r\nring at the bell again, and then another ring. \r\n\r\n“Gandalf for certain this time,” he thought as he puffed along the passage. But it was not. It was \r\ntwo more dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and yellow beards; and each of them carried a \r\nbag of tools and a spade. In they hopped, as soon as the door began to open — Bilbo was hardly \r\nsurprised at all. \r\n\r\n“What can I do for you, my dwarves?” he said. \r\n\r\n“Kili at your service!” said the one. “And Fili!” added the other; and they both swept off their blue \r\nhoods and bowed. \r\n\r\n“At yours and your family’s!” replied Bilbo, remembering his manners this time. \r\n\r\n“Dwalin and Balin here already, I see,” said Kili. “Let us join the throng!” \r\n\r\n“Throng!” thought Mr. Baggins. “I don’t like the sound of that. I really must sit down for a minute \r\nand collect my wits, and have a drink.” He had only just had a sip — in the corner, while the four \r\ndwarves sat round the table, and talked about mines and gold and troubles with the goblins, and the \r\ndepredations of dragons, and lots of other things which he did not understand, and did not want to, for \r\nthey sounded much too adventurous — when, ding-dong-a-ling-dang, his bell rang again, as if some \r\nnaughty little hobbit-boy was trying to pull the handle off. \r\n\r\n“Someone at the door!” he said, blinking. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Some four, I should say by the sound,” said Fili. “Besides, we saw them coming along behind us \r\nin the distance.” \r\n\r\nThe poor little hobbit sat down in the hall and put his head in his hands, and wondered what had \r\nhappened, and what was going to happen, and whether they would all stay to supper. Then the bell \r\nrang again louder than ever, and he had to run to the door. It was not four after all, it was five. Another \r\ndwarf had come along while he was wondering in the hall. He had hardly turned the knob, before they \r\nwere all inside, bowing and saying “at your service” one after another. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin \r\nwere their names; and very soon two purple hoods, a grey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood were \r\nhanging on the pegs, and off they marched with their broad hands stuck in their gold and silver belts to \r\njoin the others. Already it had almost become a throng. Some called for ale, and some for porter, and \r\none for coffee, and all of them for cakes; so the hobbit was kept very busy for a while. \r\n\r\nA big jug of coffee had just been set in the hearth, the seed-cakes were gone, and the dwarves were \r\nstarting on a round of buttered scones, when there came — a loud knock. Not a ring, but a hard rat-tat \r\non the hobbit’s beautiful green door. Somebody was banging with a stick! \r\n\r\nBilbo rushed along the passage, very angry, and altogether bewildered and bewuthered — this was \r\nthe most awkward Wednesday he ever remembered. He pulled open the door with a jerk, and they all \r\nfell in, one on top of the other. More dwarves, four more! And there was Gandalf behind, leaning on \r\nhis staff and laughing. He had made quite a dent on the beautiful door; he had also, by the way, \r\nknocked out the secret mark that he had put there the morning before. \r\n\r\n“Carefully! Carefully!” he said. “It is not like you, Bilbo, to keep friends waiting on the mat, and \r\nthen open the door like a pop-gun! Let me introduce Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and especially Thorin!” \r\n\r\n“At your service!” said Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur standing in a row. Then they hung up two yellow \r\nhoods and a pale green one; and also a sky-blue one with a long silver tassel. This last belonged to \r\nThorin, an enormously important dwarf, in fact no other than the great Thorin Oakenshield himself, \r\nwho was not at all pleased at falling flat on Bilbo’s mat with Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur on top of him. \r\nFor one thing Bombur was immensely fat and heavy. Thorin indeed was very haughty, and said \r\nnothing about service; but poor Mr. Baggins said he was sorry so many times, that at last he grunted \r\n“pray don’t mention it,” and stopped frowning. \r\n\r\n“Now we are all here!” said Gandalf, looking at the row of thirteen hoods — the best detachable \r\nparty hoods — and his own hat hanging on the pegs. “Quite a merry gathering! I hope there is \r\nsomething left for the late-comers to eat and drink! What’s that? Tea! No thank you! A little red wine, \r\nI think for me.” \r\n\r\n“And for me,” said Thorin. \r\n\r\n“And raspberry jam and apple-tart,” said Bifur. \r\n\r\n“And mince-pies and cheese,” said Bofur. \r\n\r\n“And pork-pie and salad,” said Bombur. \r\n\r\n“And more cakes — and ale — and coffee, if you don’t mind,” called the other dwarves through the \r\ndoor. \r\n\r\n“Put on a few eggs, there’s a good fellow!” Gandalf called after him, as the hobbit stumped off to \r\nthe pantries. “And just bring out the cold chicken and pickles!” \r\n\r\n“Seems to know as much about the inside of my larders as I do myself!” thought Mr. Baggins, who \r\nwas feeling positively flummoxed, and was beginning to wonder whether a most wretched adventure \r\nhad not come right into his house. By the time he had got all the bottles and dishes and knives and \r\nforks and glasses and plates and spoons and things piled up on big trays, he was getting very hot, and \r\nred in the face, and annoyed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Confusticate and bebother these dwarves!” he said aloud. “Why don’t they come and lend a \r\nhand?” Lo and behold! there stood Balin and Dwalin at the door of the kitchen, and Fili and Kili \r\nbehind them, and before he could say knife they had whisked the trays and a couple of small tables \r\ninto the parlour and set out everything afresh. \r\n\r\nGandalf sat at the head of the party with the thirteen dwarves all round: and Bilbo sat on a stool at \r\nthe fireside, nibbling at a biscuit (his appetite was quite taken away), and trying to look as if this was \r\nall perfectly ordinary and not in the least an adventure. The dwarves ate and ate, and talked and talked, \r\nand time got on. At last they pushed their chairs back, and Bilbo made a move to collect the plates and \r\nglasses. \r\n\r\n“I suppose you will all stay to supper?” he said in his politest unpressing tones. \r\n\r\n“Of course!” said Thorin. “And after. We shan’t get through the business till late, and we must \r\nhave some music first. Now to clear up!” \r\n\r\nThereupon the twelve dwarves — not Thorin, he was too important, and stayed talking to Gandalf — \r\njumped to their feet, and made tall piles of all the things. Off they went, not waiting for trays, \r\nbalancing columns of plates, each with a bottle on the top, with one hand, while the hobbit ran after \r\nthem almost squeaking with fright: “please be careful!” and “please, don’t trouble! I can manage.” But \r\nthe dwarves only started to sing: \r\n\r\n\r\nChip the glasses and crack the plates! \r\n\r\nBlunt the knives and bend the forks! \r\nThat’s what Bilbo Baggins hates- \r\nSmash the bottles and burn the corks! \r\n\r\n\r\nCut the cloth and tread on the fat! \r\n\r\nPour the milk on the pantry floor! \r\nLeave the bones on the bedroom mat! \r\nSplash the wine on every door! \r\n\r\n\r\nDump the crocks in a boiling bowl; \r\n\r\nPound them up with a thumping pole; \r\nAnd when you’ve finished, if any are whole, \r\nSend them down the hall to roll! \r\n\r\n\r\nThat’s what Bilbo Baggins hates! \r\n\r\nSo, carefully! carefully with the plates! \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd of course they did none of these dreadful things, and everything was cleaned and put away safe \r\nas quick as lightning, while the hobbit was turning round and round in the middle of the kitchen trying \r\nto see what they were doing. Then they went back, and found Thorin with his feet on the fender \r\nsmoking a pipe. He was blowing the most enormous smoke-rings, and wherever he told one to go, it \r\nwent — up the chimney, or behind the clock on the mantelpiece, or under the table, or round and round \r\nthe ceiling; but wherever it went it was not quick enough to escape Gandalf. Pop! he sent a smaller \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsmoke-ring from his short clay-pipe straight through each one of Thorin’ s. Then Gandalf’s smoke-ring \r\nwould go green and come back to hover over the wizard’s head. He had a cloud of them about him \r\nalready, and in the dim light it made him look strange and sorcerous. Bilbo stood still and watched — \r\nhe loved smoke-rings — and then he blushed to think how proud he had been yesterday morning of the \r\nsmoke-rings he had sent up the wind over The Hill. \r\n\r\n“Now for some music!” said Thorin. “Bring out the instruments!” \r\n\r\nKili and Fili rushed for their bags and brought back little fiddles; Dori, Nori, and Ori brought out \r\nflutes from somewhere inside their coats; Bombur produced a drum from the hall; Bifur and Bofur \r\nwent out too, and came back with clarinets that they had left among the walking-sticks. Dwalin and \r\nBalin said: “Excuse me, I left mine in the porch!” “Just bring mine in with you!” said Thorin. They \r\ncame back with viols as big as themselves, and with Thorin’ s harp wrapped in a green cloth. It was a \r\nbeautiful golden harp, and when Thorin struck it the music began all at once, so sudden and sweet that \r\nBilbo forgot everything else, and was swept away into dark lands under strange moons, far over The \r\nWater and very far from his hobbit-hole under The Hill. \r\n\r\nThe dark came into the room from the little window that opened in the side of The Hill; the \r\nfirelight flickered — it was April — and still they played on, while the shadow of Gandalf’s beard \r\nwagged against the wall. \r\n\r\nThe dark filled all the room, and the fire died down, and the shadows were lost, and still they \r\nplayed on. And suddenly first one and then another began to sing as they played, deep-throated singing \r\nof the dwarves in the deep places of their ancient homes; and this is like a fragment of their song, if it \r\ncan be like their song without their music. \r\n\r\n\r\nFar over the misty mountains cold \r\nTo dungeons deep and caverns old \r\nWe must away ere break of day \r\nTo seek the pale enchanted gold. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe dwarves of yore made mighty spells, \r\nWhile hammers fell like ringing bells \r\nIn places deep, where dark things sleep, \r\nIn hollow halls beneath the fells. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor ancient king and elvish lord \r\nThere many a gleaming golden hoard \r\nThey shaped and wrought, and light they caught \r\nTo hide in gems on hilt of sword. \r\n\r\n\r\nOn silver necklaces they strung \r\n\r\nThe flowering stars, on crowns they hung \r\n\r\nThe dragon-fire, in twisted wire \r\n\r\nThey meshed the light of moon and sun. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFar over the misty mountains cold \r\nTo dungeons deep and caverns old \r\nWe must away, ere break of day, \r\nTo claim our long-forgotten gold. \r\n\r\n\r\nGoblets they carved there for themselves \r\nAnd harps of gold; where no man delves \r\nThere lay they long, and many a song \r\nWas sung unheard by men or elves. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe pines were roaring on the height, \r\nThe winds were moaning in the night. \r\nThe fire was red, it flaming spread; \r\n\r\nThe trees like torches blazed with light. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe bells were ringing in the dale \r\nAnd men looked up with faces pale; \r\nThe dragon’s ire more fierce than fire \r\nLaid low their towers and houses frail. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe mountain smoked beneath the moon; \r\nThe dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom. \r\nThey fled their hall to dying fall \r\nBeneath his feet, beneath the moon. \r\n\r\n\r\nFar over the misty mountains grim \r\nTo dungeons deep and caverns dim \r\nWe must away, ere break of day, \r\n\r\nTo win our harps and gold from him! \r\n\r\n\r\nAs they sang the hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands and by cunning and by \r\nmagic moving through him, a fierce and a jealous love, the desire of the hearts of dwarves. Then \r\nsomething Tookish woke up inside him, and he wished to go and see the great mountains, and hear the \r\npine-trees and the waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking-stick. He \r\nlooked out of the window. The stars were out in a dark sky above the trees. He thought of the jewels of \r\nthe dwarves shining in dark caverns. Suddenly in the wood beyond The Water a flame leapt up — \r\nprobably somebody lighting a wood-fire — and he thought of plundering dragons settling on his quiet \r\nHill and kindling it all to flames. He shuddered; and very quickly he was plain Mr. Baggins of Bag- \r\nEnd, Under-Hill, again. \r\n\r\nHe got up trembling. He had less than half a mind to fetch the lamp, and more than half a mind to \r\npretend to, and go and hide behind the beer-barrels in the cellar, and not come out again until all the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndwarves had gone away. Suddenly he found that the music and the singing had stopped, and they were \r\nall looking at him with eyes shining in the dark. \r\n\r\n“Where are you going?” said Thorin, in a tone that seemed to show that he guessed both halves of \r\nthe hobbit’s mind. \r\n\r\n“What about a little light?” said Bilbo apologetically. \r\n\r\n“We like the dark,” said all the dwarves. “Dark for dark business! There are many hours before \r\ndawn.” \r\n\r\n“Of course!” said Bilbo, and sat down in a hurry. He missed the stool and sat in the fender, \r\nknocking over the poker and shovel with a crash. \r\n\r\n“Hush!” said Gandalf. “Let Thorin speak!” And this is how Thorin began. \r\n\r\n“Gandalf, dwarves and Mr. Baggins! We are met together in the house of our friend and fellow \r\nconspirator, this most excellent and audacious hobbit — may the hair on his toes never fall out! all \r\npraise to his wine and ale! — ” He paused for breath and for a polite remark from the hobbit, but the \r\ncompliments were quite lost on poor Bilbo Baggins, who was wagging his mouth in protest at being \r\ncalled audacious and worst of all fellow conspirator, though no noise came out, he was so flummoxed. \r\nSo Thorin went on: \r\n\r\n“We are met to discuss our plans, our ways, means, policy and devices. We shall soon before the \r\nbreak of day start on our long journey, a journey from which some of us, or perhaps all of us (except \r\nour friend and counsellor, the ingenious wizard Gandalf) may never return. It is a solemn moment. \r\n\r\nOur object is, I take it, well known to us all. To the estimable Mr. Baggins, and perhaps to one or two \r\nof the younger dwarves (I think I should be right in naming Kili and Fili, for instance), the exact \r\nsituation at the moment may require a little brief explanation — ” \r\n\r\nThis was Thorin’ s style. He was an important dwarf. If he had been allowed, he would probably \r\nhave gone on like this until he was out of breath, without telling any one there anything that was not \r\nknown already. But he was rudely interrupted. Poor Bilbo couldn’t bear it any longer. At may never \r\nreturn he began to feel a shriek coming up inside, and very soon it burst out like the whistle of an \r\nengine coming out of a tunnel. All the dwarves sprang up, knocking over the table. Gandalf struck a \r\nblue light on the end of his magic staff, and in its firework glare the poor little hobbit could be seen \r\nkneeling on the hearth-rug, shaking like a jelly that was melting. Then he fell flat on the floor, and \r\nkept on calling out “struck by lightning, struck by lightning!” over and over again; and that was all \r\nthey could get out of him for a long time. So they took him and laid him out of the way on the \r\ndrawing-room sofa with a drink at his elbow, and they went back to their dark business. \r\n\r\n“Excitable little fellow,” said Gandalf, as they sat down again. “Gets funny queer fits, but he is one \r\nof the best, one of the best — as fierce as a dragon in a pinch.” \r\n\r\nIf you have ever seen a dragon in a pinch, you will realize that this was only poetical exaggeration \r\napplied to any hobbit, even to Old Took’s great-grand-uncle Bullroarer, who was so huge (for a \r\nhobbit) that he could ride a horse. He charged the ranks of the goblins of Mount Gram in the Battle of \r\nthe Green Fields, and knocked their king Golfimbul’s head clean off with a wooden club. It sailed a \r\nhundred yards through the air and went down a rabbit-hole, and in this way the battle was won and the \r\ngame of Golf invented at the same moment. \r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, however, Bullroarer’ s gentler descendant was reviving in the drawing-room. \r\nAfter a while and a drink he crept nervously to the door of the parlour. This is what he heard, Gloin \r\nspeaking: “Humph!” (or some snort more or less like that). “Will he do, do you think? It is all very \r\nwell for Gandalf to talk about this hobbit being fierce, but one shriek like that in a moment of \r\nexcitement would be enough to wake the dragon and all his relatives, and kill the lot of us. I think it \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsounded more like fright than excitement! In fact, if it had not been for the sign on the door, I should \r\nhave been sure we had come to the wrong house. As soon as I clapped eyes on the little fellow bobbing \r\nand puffing on the mat, I had my doubts. He looks more like a grocer than a burglar!” \r\n\r\nThen Mr. Baggins turned the handle and went in. The Took side had won. He suddenly felt he \r\nwould go without bed and breakfast to be thought fierce. As for little fellow bobbing on the mat it \r\nalmost made him really fierce. Many a time afterwards the Baggins part regretted what he did now, \r\nand he said to himself: “Bilbo, you were a fool; you walked right in and put your foot in it.” \r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” he said, “if I have overheard words that you were saying. I don’t pretend to \r\nunderstand what you are talking about, or your reference to burglars, but I think I am right in \r\nbelieving” (this is what he called being on his dignity) “that you think I am no good. I will show you. I \r\nhave no signs on my door — it was painted a week ago — , and I am quite sure you have come to the \r\nwrong house. As soon as I saw your funny faces on the door-step, I had my doubts. But treat it as the \r\nright one. Tell me what you want done, and I will try it, if I have to walk from here to the East of East \r\nand fight the wild Were-worms in the Last Desert. I had a great-great-great-grand-uncle once, \r\nBullroarer Took, and — ” \r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, but that was long ago,” said Gloin. “I was talking about you. And I assure you there is a \r\nmark on this door — the usual one in the trade, or used to be. Burglar wants a good job, plenty of \r\nExcitement and reasonable Reward, that’s how it is usually read. You can say Expert Treasure-hunter \r\ninstead of Burglar if you like. Some of them do. It’s all the same to us. Gandalf told us that there was \r\na man of the sort in these parts looking for a Job at once, and that he had arranged for a meeting here \r\nthis Wednesday tea-time.” \r\n\r\n“Of course there is a mark,” said Gandalf. “I put it there myself. For very good reasons. You asked \r\nme to find the fourteenth man for your expedition, and I chose Mr. Baggins. Just let any one say I \r\nchose the wrong man or the wrong house, and you can stop at thirteen and have all the bad luck you \r\nlike, or go back to digging coal.” \r\n\r\nHe scowled so angrily at Gloin that the dwarf huddled back in his chair; and when Bilbo tried to \r\nopen his mouth to ask a question, he turned and frowned at him and stuck out his bushy eyebrows, till \r\nBilbo shut his mouth tight with a snap. “That’s right,” said Gandalf. “Let’s have no more argument. I \r\nhave chosen Mr. Baggins and that ought to be enough for all of you. If I say he is a Burglar, a Burglar \r\nhe is, or will be when the time comes. There is a lot more in him than you guess, and a deal more than \r\nhe has any idea of himself. You may (possibly) all live to thank me yet. Now Bilbo, my boy, fetch the \r\nlamp, and let’s have a little light on this!” \r\n\r\nOn the table in the light of a big lamp with a red shade he spread a piece of parchment rather like a \r\nmap. \r\n\r\n“This was made by Thror, your grandfather, Thorin,” he said in answer to the dwarves’ excited \r\nquestions. “It is a plan of the Mountain.” \r\n\r\n“I don’t see that this will help us much,” said Thorin disappointedly after a glance. “I remember \r\nthe Mountain well enough and the lands about it. And I know where Mirkwood is, and the Withered \r\nHeath where the great dragons bred.” \r\n\r\n“There is a dragon marked in red on the Mountain,” said Balin, “but it will be easy enough to find \r\nhim without that, if ever we arrive there.” \r\n\r\n“There is one point that you haven’t noticed,” said the wizard, “and that is the secret entrance. You \r\nsee that rune on the West side, and the hand pointing to it from the other runes? That marks a hidden \r\npassage to the Lower Halls.” (Look at the map at the beginning of this book, and you will see there the \r\nrunes.) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“It may have been secret once,” said Thorin, “but how do we know that it is secret any longer? Old \r\nSmaug has lived there long enough now to find out anything there is to know about those caves.” \r\n\r\n“He may — but he can’t have used it for years and years.” \r\n\r\n“Why?” \r\n\r\n“Because it is too small. ‘ Five feet high the door and three may walk abreast ’ say the runes, but \r\nSmaug could not creep into a hole that size, not even when he was a young dragon, certainly not after \r\ndevouring so many of the dwarves and men of Dale.” \r\n\r\n“It seems a great big hole to me,” squeaked Bilbo (who had no experience of dragons and only of \r\nhobbit-holes). He was getting excited and interested again, so that he forgot to keep his mouth shut. \r\n\r\nHe loved maps, and in his hall there hung a large one of the Country Round with all his favourite \r\nwalks marked on it in red ink. “How could such a large door be kept secret from everybody outside, \r\napart from the dragon?” he asked. He was only a little hobbit you must remember. \r\n\r\n“In lots of ways,” said Gandalf. “But in what way this one has been hidden we don’t know without \r\ngoing to see. From what it says on the map I should guess there is a closed door which has been made \r\nto look exactly like the side of the Mountain. That is the usual dwarves’ method — I think that is right, \r\nisn’t it?” \r\n\r\n“Quite right,” said Thorin. \r\n\r\n“Also,” went on Gandalf, “I forgot to mention that with the map went a key, a small and curious \r\nkey. Here it is!” he said, and handed to Thorin a key with a long barrel and intricate wards, made of \r\nsilver. “Keep it safe!” \r\n\r\n“Indeed I will,” said Thorin, and he fastened it upon a fine chain that hung about his neck and \r\nunder his jacket. “Now things begin to look more hopeful. This news alters them much for the better. \r\nSo far we have had no clear idea what to do. We thought of going East, as quiet and careful as we \r\ncould, as far as the Long Lake. After that the trouble would begin — .” \r\n\r\n“A long time before that, if I know anything about the roads East,” interrupted Gandalf. \r\n\r\n“We might go from there up along the River Running,” went on Thorin taking no notice, “and so to \r\nthe ruins of Dale — the old town in the valley there, under the shadow of the Mountain. But we none of \r\nus liked the idea of the Front Gate. The river runs right out of it through the great cliff at the South of \r\nthe Mountain, and out of it comes the dragon too — far too often, unless he has changed his habits.” \r\n\r\n“That would be no good,” said the wizard, “not without a mighty Warrior, even a Hero. I tried to \r\nfind one; but warriors are busy fighting one another in distant lands, and in this neighbourhood heroes \r\nare scarce, or simply not to be found. Swords in these parts are mostly blunt, and axes are used for \r\ntrees, and shields as cradles or dish-covers; and dragons are comfortably far-off (and therefore \r\nlegendary). That is why I settled on burglary — especially when I remembered the existence of a Side- \r\ndoor. And here is our little Bilbo Baggins, the burglar, the chosen and selected burglar. So now let’s \r\nget on and make some plans.” \r\n\r\n“Very well then,” said Thorin, “supposing the burglar-expert gives us some ideas or suggestions.” \r\nHe turned with mock-politeness to Bilbo. \r\n\r\n“First I should like to know a bit more about things,” said he, feeling all confused and a bit shaky \r\ninside, but so far still Tookishly determined to go on with things. “I mean about the gold and the \r\ndragon, and all that, and how it got there, and who it belongs to, and so on and further.” \r\n\r\n“Bless me!” said Thorin, “haven’t you got a map? and didn’t you hear our song? and haven’t we \r\nbeen talking about all this for hours?” \r\n\r\n“All the same, I should like it all plain and clear,” said he obstinately, putting on his business \r\nmanner (usually reserved for people who tried to borrow money off him), and doing his best to appear \r\n\r\n\r\nwise and prudent and professional and live up to Gandalf’s recommendation. “Also I should like to \r\nknow about risks, out-of-pocket expenses, time required and remuneration, and so forth” — by which \r\nhe meant: “What am I going to get out of it? and am I going to come back alive?” \r\n\r\n“O very well,” said Thorin. “Long ago in my grandfather Thror’s time our family was driven out of \r\nthe far North, and came back with all their wealth and their tools to this Mountain on the map. It had \r\nbeen discovered by my far ancestor, Thrain the Old, but now they mined and they tunnelled and they \r\nmade huger halls and greater workshops — and in addition I believe they found a good deal of gold and \r\na great many jewels too. Anyway they grew immensely rich and famous, and my grandfather was King \r\nunder the Mountain again, and treated with great reverence by the mortal men, who lived to the South, \r\nand were gradually spreading up the Running River as far as the valley overshadowed by the \r\nMountain. They built the merry town of Dale there in those days. Kings used to send for our smiths, \r\nand reward even the least skillful most richly. Fathers would beg us to take their sons as apprentices, \r\nand pay us handsomely, especially in food-supplies, which we never bothered to grow or find for \r\nourselves. Altogether those were good days for us, and the poorest of us had money to spend and to \r\nlend, and leisure to make beautiful things just for the fun of it, not to speak of the most marvellous \r\nand magical toys, the like of which is not to be found in the world now-a-days. So my grandfather’s \r\nhalls became full of armour and jewels and carvings and cups, and the toy market of Dale was the \r\nwonder of the North. \r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly that was what brought the dragon. Dragons steal gold and jewels, you know, from \r\nmen and elves and dwarves, wherever they can find them; and they guard their plunder as long as they \r\nlive (which is practically for ever, unless they are killed), and never enjoy a brass ring of it. Indeed \r\nthey hardly know a good bit of work from a bad, though they usually have a good notion of the current \r\nmarket value; and they can’t make a thing for themselves, not even mend a little loose scale of their \r\narmour. There were lots of dragons in the North in those days, and gold was probably getting scarce up \r\nthere, with the dwarves flying south or getting killed, and all the general waste and destruction that \r\ndragons make going from bad to worse. There was a most specially greedy, strong and wicked worm \r\ncalled Smaug. One day he flew up into the air and came south. The first we heard of it was a noise like \r\na hurricane coming from the North, and the pine-trees on the Mountain creaking and cracking in the \r\nwind. Some of the dwarves who happened to be outside (I was one luckily — a fine adventurous lad in \r\nthose days, always wandering about, and it saved my life that day) — well, from a good way off we saw \r\nthe dragon settle on our mountain in a spout of flame. Then he came down the slopes and when he \r\nreached the woods they all went up in fire. By that time all the bells were ringing in Dale and the \r\nwarriors were arming. The dwarves rushed out of their great gate; but there was the dragon waiting for \r\nthem. None escaped that way. The river rushed up in steam and a fog fell on Dale, and in the fog the \r\ndragon came on them and destroyed most of the warriors — the usual unhappy story, it was only too \r\ncommon in those days. Then he went back and crept in through the Front Gate and routed out all the \r\nhalls, and lanes, and tunnels, alleys, cellars, mansions and passages. After that there were no dwarves \r\nleft alive inside, and he took all their wealth for himself. Probably, for that is the dragons’ way, he has \r\npiled it all up in a great heap far inside, and sleeps on it for a bed. Later he used to crawl out of the \r\ngreat gate and come by night to Dale, and carry away people, especially maidens, to eat, until Dale \r\nwas ruined, and all the people dead or gone. What goes on there now I don’t know for certain, but I \r\ndon’t suppose any one lives nearer to the Mountain than the far edge of the Long Lake now-a-days. \r\n\r\n“The few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding, and cursed Smaug; and there we were \r\nunexpectedly joined by my father and my grandfather with singed beards. They looked very grim but \r\nthey said very little. When I asked how they had got away, they told me to hold my tongue, and said \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat one day in the proper time I should know. After that we went away, and we have had to earn our \r\nlivings as best we could up and down the lands, often enough sinking as low as blacksmith-work or \r\neven coalmining. But we have never forgotten our stolen treasure. And even now, when I will allow \r\nwe have a good bit laid by and are not so badly off” — here Thorin stroked the gold chain round his \r\nneck — “we still mean to get it back, and to bring our curses home to Smaug — if we can. \r\n\r\n“I have often wondered about my father’s and my grandfather’s escape. I see now they must have \r\nhad a private Side-door which only they knew about. But apparently they made a map, and I should \r\nlike to know how Gandalf got hold of it, and why it did not come down to me, the rightful heir.” \r\n\r\n“I did not ‘get hold of it,’ I was given it,” said the wizard. “Your grandfather Thror was killed, you \r\nremember, in the mines of Moria by Azog the Goblin .” \r\n\r\n“Curse his name, yes,” said Thorin. \r\n\r\n“And Thrain your father went away on the twenty-first of April, a hundred years ago last Thursday, \r\nand has never been seen by you since-” \r\n\r\n“True, true,” said Thorin. \r\n\r\n“Well, your father gave me this to give to you; and if I have chosen my own time and way for \r\nhanding it over, you can hardly blame me, considering the trouble I had to find you. Your father could \r\nnot remember his own name when he gave me the paper, and he never told me yours; so on the whole I \r\nthink I ought to be praised and thanked! Here it is,” said he handing the map to Thorin. \r\n\r\n“I don’t understand,” said Thorin, and Bilbo felt he would have liked to say the same. The \r\nexplanation did not seem to explain. \r\n\r\n“Your grandfather,” said the wizard slowly and grimly, “gave the map to his son for safety before \r\nhe went to the mines of Moria. Your father went away to try his luck with the map after your \r\ngrandfather was killed; and lots of adventures of a most unpleasant sort he had, but he never got near \r\nthe Mountain. How he got there I don’t know, but I found him a prisoner in the dungeons of the \r\nNecromancer.” \r\n\r\n“Whatever were you doing there?” asked Thorin with a shudder, and all the dwarves shivered. \r\n\r\n“Never you mind. I was finding things out, as usual; and a nasty dangerous business it was. Even I, \r\nGandalf, only just escaped. I tried to save your father, but it was too late. He was witless and \r\nwandering, and had forgotten almost everything except the map and the key.” \r\n\r\n“We have long ago paid the goblins of Moria,” said Thorin; “we must give a thought to the \r\nNecromancer.” \r\n\r\n“Don’t be absurd! He is an enemy far beyond the powers of all the dwarves put together, if they \r\ncould all be collected again from the four corners of the world. The one thing your father wished was \r\nfor his son to read the map and use the key. The dragon and the Mountain are more than big enough \r\ntasks for you!” \r\n\r\n“Hear, hear!” said Bilbo, and accidentally said it aloud. \r\n\r\n“Hear what?” they all said turning suddenly towards him, and he was so flustered that he answered \r\n“Hear what I have got to say!” \r\n\r\n“What’s that?” they asked. \r\n\r\n“Well, I should say that you ought to go East and have a look round. After all there is the Side- \r\ndoor, and dragons must sleep sometimes, I suppose. If you sit on the door-step long enough, I daresay \r\nyou will think of something. And well, don’t you know, I think we have talked long enough for one \r\nnight, if you see what I mean. What about bed, and an early start, and all that? I will give you a good \r\nbreakfast before you go.” \r\n\r\n“Before we go, I suppose you mean,” said Thorin. “Aren’t you the burglar? And isn’t sitting on the \r\n\r\n\r\ndoor-step your job, not to speak of getting inside the door? But I agree about bed and breakfast. I like \r\nsix eggs with my ham, when starting on a journey: fried not poached, and mind you don’t break ’em.” \r\n\r\nAfter all the others had ordered their breakfasts without so much as a please (which annoyed Bilbo \r\nvery much), they all got up. The hobbit had to find room for them all, and filled all his spare-rooms \r\nand made beds on chairs and sofas, before he got them all stowed and went to his own little bed very \r\ntired and not altogether happy. One thing he did make his mind up about was not to bother to get up \r\nvery early and cook everybody else’s wretched breakfast. The Tookishness was wearing off, and he \r\nwas not now quite so sure that he was going on any journey in the morning. \r\n\r\nAs he lay in bed he could hear Thorin still humming to himself in the best bedroom next to him: \r\n\r\nFar over the misty mountains cold \r\nTo dungeons deep and caverns old \r\nWe must away, ere break of day, \r\n\r\nTo find our long-forgotten gold. \r\n\r\nBilbo went to sleep with that in his ears, and it gave him very uncomfortable dreams. It was long \r\nafter the break of day, when he woke up."

    "ChapterData": "Up jumped Bilbo, and putting on his dressing-gown went into the dining-room. There he saw nobody, \r\nbut all the signs of a large and hurried breakfast. There was a fearful mess in the room, and piles of \r\nunwashed crocks in the kitchen. Nearly every pot and pan he possessed seemed to have been used. The \r\nwashing-up was so dismally real that Bilbo was forced to believe the party of the night before had not \r\nbeen part of his bad dreams, as he had rather hoped. Indeed he was really relieved after all to think \r\nthat they had all gone without him, and without bothering to wake him up (“but with never a thank- \r\nyou” he thought); and yet in a way he could not help feeling just a trifle disappointed. The feeling \r\nsurprised him. \r\n\r\n“Don’t be a fool, Bilbo Baggins!” he said to himself, “thinking of dragons and all that outlandish \r\nnonsense at your age!” So he put on an apron, lit fires, boiled water, and washed up. Then he had a \r\nnice little breakfast in the kitchen before turning out the dining-room. By that time the sun was \r\nshining; and the front door was open, letting in a warm spring breeze. Bilbo began to whistle loudly \r\nand to forget about the night before. In fact he was just sitting down to a nice little second breakfast in \r\nthe dining-room by the open window, when in walked Gandalf . \r\n\r\n“My dear fellow,” said he, “whenever are you going to come? What about an early start ? — and \r\nhere you are having breakfast, or whatever you call it, at half past ten! They left you the message, \r\nbecause they could not wait.” \r\n\r\n“What message?” said poor Mr. Baggins all in a fluster. \r\n\r\n“Great Elephants!” said Gandalf, “you are not at all yourself this morning — you have never dusted \r\nthe mantelpiece!” \r\n\r\n“What’s that got to do with it? I have had enough to do with washing up for fourteen!” \r\n\r\n“If you had dusted the mantelpiece, you would have found this just under the clock,” said Gandalf, \r\nhanding Bilbo a note (written, of course, on his own note-paper). \r\n\r\nThis is what he read: \r\n\r\n\r\n“Thorin and Company to Burglar Bilbo greeting! For your hospitality our sincerest thanks, and for \r\nyour offer of professional assistance our grateful acceptance. Terms: cash on delivery, up to and not \r\nexceeding one fourteenth of total profits (if any); all travelling expenses guaranteed in any event; \r\nfuneral expenses to be defrayed by us or our representatives, if occasion arises and the matter is not \r\notherwise arranged for. \r\n\r\n“Thinking it unnecessary to disturb your esteemed repose, we have proceeded in advance to make \r\nrequisite preparations, and shall await your respected person at the Green Dragon Inn, Bywater, at 11 \r\na.m. sharp. Trusting that you will be punctual, \r\n\r\n“ We have the honour to remain \r\n“ Yours deeply \r\n“ Thorin & Co.” \r\n\r\n\r\n“That leaves you just ten minutes. You will have to run,” said Gandalf. \r\n\r\n“But — said Bilbo. \r\n\r\n“No time for it,” said the wizard. \r\n\r\n“But — ,” said Bilbo again. \r\n\r\n“No time for that either! Off you go!” \r\n\r\nTo the end of his days Bilbo could never remember how he found himself outside, without a hat, a \r\nwalking-stick or any money, or anything that he usually took when he went out; leaving his second \r\nbreakfast half-finished and quite unwashed-up, pushing his keys into Gandalf’ s hands, and running as \r\nfast as his furry feet could carry him down the lane, past the great Mill, across The Water, and then on \r\nfor a mile or more. \r\n\r\nVery puffed he was, when he got to Bywater just on the stroke of eleven, and found he had come \r\nwithout a pocket-handkerchief! \r\n\r\n“Bravo!” said Balin who was standing at the inn door looking out for him. \r\n\r\nJust then all the others came round the corner of the road from the village. They were on ponies, \r\nand each pony was slung about with all kinds of baggages, packages, parcels, and paraphernalia. There \r\nwas a very small pony, apparently for Bilbo. \r\n\r\n“Up you two get, and off we go!” said Thorin. \r\n\r\n“I’m awfully sorry,” said Bilbo, “but I have come without my hat, and I have left my pocket- \r\nhandkerchief behind, and I haven’t got any money. I didn’t get your note until after 10.45 to be \r\nprecise.” \r\n\r\n“Don’t be precise,” said Dwalin, “and don’t worry! You will have to manage without pocket- \r\nhandkerchiefs, and a good many other things, before you get to the journey’s end. As for a hat, I have \r\ngot a spare hood and cloak in my luggage.” \r\n\r\nThat’s how they all came to start, jogging off from the inn one fine morning just before May, on \r\nladen ponies; and Bilbo was wearing a dark-green hood (a little weather-stained) and a dark-green \r\ncloak borrowed from Dwalin. They were too large for him, and he looked rather comic. What his \r\nfather Bungo would have thought of him, I daren’t think. His only comfort was he couldn’t be \r\nmistaken for a dwarf, as he had no beard. \r\n\r\nThey had not been riding very long, when up came Gandalf very splendid on a white horse. He had \r\nbrought a lot of pocket-handkerchiefs, and Bilbo’s pipe and tobacco. So after that the party went along \r\nvery merrily, and they told stories or sang songs as they rode forward all day, except of course when \r\nthey stopped for meals. These didn’t come quite as often as Bilbo would have liked them, but still he \r\nbegan to feel that adventures were not so bad after all. \r\n\r\nAt first they had passed through hobbit-lands, a wide respectable country inhabited by decent folk, \r\nwith good roads, an inn or two, and now and then a dwarf or a farmer ambling by on business. Then \r\nthey came to lands where people spoke strangely, and sang songs Bilbo had never heard before. Now \r\nthey had gone on far into the Lone-lands, where there were no people left, no inns, and the roads grew \r\nsteadily worse. Not far ahead were dreary hills, rising higher and higher, dark with trees. On some of \r\nthem were old castles with an evil look, as if they had been built by wicked people. Everything seemed \r\ngloomy, for the weather that day had taken a nasty turn. Mostly it had been as good as May can be, can \r\nbe, even in merry tales, but now it was cold and wet. In the Lone-lands they had been obliged to camp \r\nwhen they could, but at least it had been dry. \r\n\r\n“To think it will soon be June!” grumbled Bilbo, as he splashed along behind the others in a very \r\nmuddy track. It was after tea-time; it was pouring with rain, and had been all day; his hood was \r\ndripping into his eyes, his cloak was full of water; the pony was tired and stumbled on stones; the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nothers were too grumpy to talk. “And I’m sure the rain has got into the dry clothes and into the food- \r\nbags,” thought Bilbo. “Bother burgling and everything to do with it! I wish I was at home in my nice \r\nhole by the fire, with the kettle just beginning to sing!” It was not the last time that he wished that! \r\n\r\nStill the dwarves jogged on, never turning round or taking any notice of the hobbit. Somewhere \r\nbehind the grey clouds the sun must have gone down, for it began to get dark as they went down into a \r\ndeep valley with a river at the bottom. Wind got up, and willows along its banks bent and sighed. \r\nFortunately the road went over an ancient stone bridge, for the river, swollen with the rains, came \r\nrushing down from the hills and mountains in the north. \r\n\r\nIt was nearly night when they had crossed over. The wind broke up the grey clouds, and a \r\nwandering moon appeared above the hills between the flying rags. Then they stopped, and Thorin \r\nmuttered something about supper, “and where shall we get a dry patch to sleep on?” Not until then did \r\nthey notice that Gandalf was missing. So far he had come all the way with them, never saying if he \r\nwas in the adventure or merely keeping them company for a while. He had eaten most, talked most, \r\nand laughed most. But now he simply was not there at all! \r\n\r\n\r\n“Just when a wizard would have been most useful, too,” groaned Dori and Nori (who shared the \r\nhobbit’s views about regular meals, plenty and often). \r\n\r\nThey decided in the end that they would have to camp where they were. They moved to a clump of \r\ntrees, and though it was drier under them, the wind shook the rain off the leaves, and the drip, drip, \r\nwas most annoying. Also the mischief seemed to have got into the fire. Dwarves can make a fire \r\nalmost anywhere out of almost anything, wind or no wind; but they could not do it that night, not even \r\nOin and Gloin, who were specially good at it. \r\n\r\nThen one of the ponies took fright at nothing and bolted. He got into the river before they could \r\ncatch him; and before they could get him out again, Fili and Kili were nearly drowned, and all the \r\nbaggage that he carried was washed away off him. Of course it was mostly food, and there was mighty \r\nlittle left for supper, and less for breakfast. \r\n\r\nThere they all sat glum and wet and muttering, while Oin and Gloin went on trying to light the fire, \r\nand quarrelling about it. Bilbo was sadly reflecting that adventures are not all pony-rides in May- \r\nsunshine, when Balin, who was always their look-out man, said: “There’s a light over there!” There \r\nwas a hill some way off with trees on it, pretty thick in parts. Out of the dark mass of the trees they \r\ncould now see a light shining, a reddish comfortable-looking light, as it might be a fire or torches \r\ntwinkling. \r\n\r\nWhen they had looked at it for some while, they fell to arguing. Some said “no” and some said \r\n“yes”. Some said they could but go and see, and anything was better than little supper, less breakfast, \r\nand wet clothes all the night. \r\n\r\nOthers said: “These parts are none too well known, and are too near the mountains. Travellers \r\nseldom come this way now. The old maps are no use: things have changed for the worse and the road \r\nis unguarded. They have seldom even heard of the king round here, and the less inquisitive you are as \r\nyou go along, the less trouble you are likely to find.” Some said: “After all there are fourteen of us.” \r\nOthers said: “Where has Gandalf got to?” This remark was repeated by everybody. Then the rain \r\nbegan to pour down worse than ever, and Oin and Gloin began to fight. \r\n\r\nThat settled it. “After all we have got a burglar with us,” they said; and so they made off, leading \r\ntheir ponies (with all due and proper caution) in the direction of the light. They came to the hill and \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere soon in the wood. Up the hill they went; but there was no proper path to be seen, such as might \r\nlead to a house or a farm; and do what they could they made a deal of rustling and crackling and \r\ncreaking (and a good deal of grumbling and dratting), as they went through the trees in the pitch dark. \r\n\r\nSuddenly the red light shone out very bright through the tree-trunks not far ahead. \r\n\r\n“Now it is the burglar’s turn,” they said, meaning Bilbo. “You must go on and find out all about \r\nthat light, and what it is for, and if all is perfectly safe and canny,” said Thorin to the hobbit. “Now \r\nscuttle off, and come back quick, if all is well. If not, come back if you can! If you can’t, hoot twice \r\nlike a barn-owl and once like a screech-owl, and we will do what we can.” \r\n\r\nOff Bilbo had to go, before he could explain that he could not hoot even once like any kind of owl \r\nany more than fly like a bat. But at any rate hobbits can move quietly in woods, absolutely quietly. \r\nThey take a pride in it, and Bilbo had sniffed more than once at what he called “all this dwarvish \r\nracket,” as they went along, though I don’t suppose you or I would have noticed anything at all on a \r\nwindy night, not if the whole cavalcade had passed two feet off. As for Bilbo walking primly towards \r\nthe red light, I don’t suppose even a weasel would have stirred a whisker at it. So, naturally, he got \r\nright up to the fire — for fire it was — without disturbing anyone. And this is what he saw. \r\n\r\nThree very large persons sitting round a very large fire of beech-logs. They were toasting mutton \r\non long spits of wood, and licking the gravy off their fingers. There was a fine toothsome smell. Also \r\nthere was a barrel of good drink at hand, and they were drinking out of jugs. But they were trolls. \r\nObviously trolls. Even Bilbo, in spite of his sheltered life, could see that: from the great heavy faces \r\nof them, and their size, and the shape of their legs, not to mention their language, which was not \r\ndrawing-room fashion at all, at all. \r\n\r\n“Mutton yesterday, mutton today, and blimey, if it don’t look like mutton again tomorrer,” said \r\none of the trolls. \r\n\r\n“Never a blinking bit of manflesh have we had for long enough,” said a second. “What the ’ell \r\nWilliam was a-thinkin’ of to bring us into these parts at all, beats me — and the drink runnin’ short, \r\nwhat’s more,” he said jogging the elbow of William, who was taking a pull at his jug. \r\n\r\nWilliam choked. “Shut yer mouth!” he said as soon as he could. “Yer can’t expect folk to stop here \r\nfor ever just to be et by you and Bert. You’ve et a village and a half between yer, since we come down \r\nfrom the mountains. How much more d’yer want? And time’s been up our way, when yer’d have said \r\n‘thank yer Bill’ for a nice bit o’ fat valley mutton like what this is.” He took a big bite off a sheep’s \r\nleg he was roasting, and wiped his lips on his sleeve. \r\n\r\nYes, I am afraid trolls do behave like that, even those with only one head each. After hearing all \r\nthis Bilbo ought to have done something at once. Either he should have gone back quietly and warned \r\nhis friends that there were three fair-sized trolls at hand in a nasty mood, quite likely to try roasted \r\ndwarf, or even pony, for a change; or else he should have done a bit of good quick burgling. A really \r\nfirst-class and legendary burglar would at this point have picked the trolls’ pockets — it is nearly \r\nalways worth while, if you can manage it — , pinched the very mutton off the spits, purloined the beer, \r\nand walked off without their noticing him. Others more practical but with less professional pride \r\nwould perhaps have stuck a dagger into each of them before they observed it. Then the night could \r\nhave been spent cheerily. \r\n\r\nBilbo knew it. He had read of a good many things he had never seen or done. He was very much \r\nalarmed, as well as disgusted; he wished himself a hundred miles away, and yet — and yet somehow he \r\ncould not go straight back to Thorin and Company emptyhanded. So he stood and hesitated in the \r\nshadows. Of the various burglarious proceedings he had heard of picking the trolls’ pockets seemed \r\nthe least difficult, so at last he crept behind a tree just behind William. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBert and Tom went off to the barrel. William was having another drink. Then Bilbo plucked up \r\ncourage and put his little hand in William’s enormous pocket. There was a purse in it, as big as a bag \r\nto Bilbo. “Ha!” thought he, warming to his new work as he lifted it carefully out, “this is a beginning!” \r\nIt was! Trolls’ purses are the mischief, and this was no exception. “’Ere, ’oo are you?” it squeaked, \r\nas it left the pocket; and William turned round at once and grabbed Bilbo by the neck, before he could \r\nduck behind the tree. \r\n\r\n“Blimey, Bert, look what I’ve copped!” said William. \r\n\r\n“What is it?” said the others coming up. “Lumme, if I knows! What are yer?” \r\n\r\n“Bilbo Baggins, a bur — a hobbit,” said poor Bilbo, shaking all over, and wondering how to make \r\nowl-noises before they throttled him. \r\n\r\n“A burrahobbit?” said they a bit startled. Trolls are slow in the uptake, and mighty suspicious about \r\nanything new to them. \r\n\r\n“What’s a burrahobbit got to do with my pocket, anyways?” said William. \r\n\r\n“And can yer cook ’em?” said Tom. \r\n\r\n“Yer can try,” said Bert, picking up a skewer. \r\n\r\n“He wouldn’t make above a mouthful,” said William, who had already had a fine supper, “not \r\nwhen he was skinned and boned.” \r\n\r\n“P’raps there are more like him round about, and we might make a pie,” said Bert. “Here you, are \r\nthere any more of your sort a-sneakin’ in these here woods, yer nassty little rabbit,” said he looking at \r\nthe hobbit’s furry feet; and he picked him up by the toes and shook him. \r\n\r\n“Yes, lots,” said Bilbo, before he remembered not to give his friends away. “No none at all, not \r\none,” he said immediately afterwards. \r\n\r\n“What d’yer mean?” said Bert, holding him right way up, by the hair this time. \r\n\r\n“What I say,” said Bilbo gasping. “And please don’t cook me, kind sirs! I am a good cook myself, \r\nand cook better than I cook, if you see what I mean. I’ll cook beautifully for you, a perfectly beautiful \r\nbreakfast for you, if only you won’t have me for supper.” \r\n\r\n“Poor little blighter,” said William. He had already had as much supper as he could hold; also he \r\nhad had lots of beer. “Poor little blighter! Let him go!” \r\n\r\n“Not till he says what he means by lots and none at all,” said Bert. “I don’t want to have me throat \r\ncut in me sleep! Hold his toes in the fire, till he talks!” \r\n\r\n“I won’t have it,” said William. “I caught him anyway.” \r\n\r\n“You’re a fat fool, William,” said Bert, “as I’ve said afore this evening.” \r\n\r\n“And you’re a lout!” \r\n\r\n“And I won’t take that from you, Bill Huggins,” says Bert, and puts his fist in William’s eye. \r\n\r\nThen there was a gorgeous row. Bilbo had just enough wits left, when Bert dropped him on the \r\nground, to scramble out of the way of their feet, before they were fighting like dogs, and calling one \r\nanother all sorts of perfectly true and applicable names in very loud voices. Soon they were locked in \r\none another’s arms, and rolling nearly into the fire kicking and thumping, while Tom whacked at them \r\nboth with a branch to bring them to their senses — and that of course only made them madder than \r\never. \r\n\r\nThat would have been the time for Bilbo to have left. But his poor little feet had been very \r\nsquashed in Bert’s big paw, and he had no breath in his body, and his head was going round; so there \r\nhe lay for a while panting, just outside the circle of firelight. \r\n\r\nRight in the middle of the fight up came Balin. The dwarves had heard noises from a distance, and \r\nafter waiting for some time for Bilbo to come back, or to hoot like an owl, they started off one by one \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto creep towards the light as quietly as they could. No sooner did Tom see Balin come into the light \r\nthan he gave an awful howl. Trolls simply detest the very sight of dwarves (uncooked). Bert and Bill \r\nstopped fighting immediately, and “a sack, Tom, quick!” they said. Before Balin, who was wondering \r\nwhere in all this commotion Bilbo was, knew what was happening, a sack was over his head, and he \r\nwas down. \r\n\r\n“There’s more to come yet,” said Tom, “or I’m mighty mistook. Lots and none at all, it is,” said he. \r\n“No burrahobbits, but lots of these here dwarves. That’s about the shape of it!” \r\n\r\n“I reckon you’re right,” said Bert, “and we’d best get out of the light.” \r\n\r\nAnd so they did. With sacks in their hands, that they used for carrying off mutton and other \r\nplunder, they waited in the shadows. As each dwarf came up and looked at the fire, and the spilled \r\njugs, and the gnawed mutton, in surprise, pop! went a nasty smelly sack over his head, and he was \r\ndown. Soon Dwalin lay by Balin, and Fili and Kili together, and Dori and Nori and Ori all in a heap, \r\nand Oin and Gloin and Bifur and Bofur and Bombur piled uncomfortably near the fire. \r\n\r\n“That’ll teach ’em,” said Tom; for Bifur and Bombur had given a lot of trouble, and fought like \r\nmad, as dwarves will when cornered. \r\n\r\nThorin came last — and he was not caught unawares. He came expecting mischief, and didn’t need \r\nto see his friends’ legs sticking out of sacks to tell him that things were not all well. He stood outside \r\nin the shadows some way off, and said: “What’s all this trouble? Who has been knocking my people \r\nabout?” \r\n\r\n“It’s trolls!” said Bilbo from behind a tree. They had forgotten all about him. “They’re hiding in \r\nthe bushes with sacks,” said he. \r\n\r\n“O! are they?” said Thorin, and he jumped forward to the fire, before they could leap on him. He \r\ncaught up a big branch all on fire at one end; and Bert got that end in his eye before he could step \r\naside. That put him out of the battle for a bit. Bilbo did his best. He caught hold of Tom’s leg — as well \r\nas he could, it was thick as a young tree-trunk — but he was sent spinning up into the top of some \r\nbushes, when Tom kicked the sparks up in Thorin’ s face. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Trolls \r\n\r\nTom got the branch in his teeth for that, and lost one of the front ones. It made him howl, I can tell \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou. But just at that moment William came up behind and popped a sack right over Thorin’s head and \r\ndown to his toes. And so the fight ended. A nice pickle they were all in now: all neatly tied up in \r\nsacks, with three angry trolls (and two with burns and bashes to remember) sitting by them, arguing \r\nwhether they should roast them slowly, or mince them fine and boil them, or just sit on them one by \r\none and squash them into jelly; and Bilbo up in a bush, with his clothes and his skin torn, not daring to \r\nmove for fear they should hear him. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt was just then that Gandalf came back. But no one saw him. The trolls had just decided to roast the \r\ndwarves now and eat them later — that was Bert’s idea, and after a lot of argument they had all agreed \r\nto it. \r\n\r\n“No good roasting ’em now, it’d take all night,” said a voice. Bert thought it was William’s. \r\n\r\n“Don’t start the argument all over again, Bill,” he said, “or it will take all night.” \r\n\r\n“Who’s a-arguing?” said William, who thought it was Bert that had spoken. \r\n\r\n“You are,” said Bert. \r\n\r\n“You’re a liar,” said William; and so the argument began all over again. In the end they decided to \r\nmince them fine and boil them. So they got a great black pot, and they took out their knives. \r\n\r\n“No good boiling ’em! We ain’t got no water, and it’s a long way to the well and all,” said a voice. \r\nBert and William thought it was Tom’s. \r\n\r\n“Shut up!” said they, “or we’ll never have done. And yer can fetch the water yerself, if yer say any \r\nmore.” \r\n\r\n“Shut up yerself!” said Tom, who thought it was William’s voice. “Who’s arguing but you, I’d like \r\nto know.” \r\n\r\n“You’re a booby,” said William. \r\n\r\n“Booby yerself!” said Tom. \r\n\r\nAnd so the argument began all over again, and went on hotter than ever, until at last they decided to \r\nsit on the sacks one by one and squash them, and boil them next time. \r\n\r\n“Who shall we sit on first?” said the voice. \r\n\r\n“Better sit on the last fellow first,” said Bert, whose eye had been damaged by Thorin. He thought \r\nTom was talking. \r\n\r\n“Don’t talk to yerself!” said Tom. “But if you wants to sit on the last one, sit on him. Which is he?” \r\n\r\n“The one with the yellow stockings,” said Bert. \r\n\r\n“Nonsense, the one with the grey stockings,” said a voice like William’s. \r\n\r\n“I made sure it was yellow,” said Bert. \r\n\r\n“Yellow it was,” said William. \r\n\r\n“Then what did yer say it was grey for?” said Bert. \r\n\r\n“I never did. Tom said it.” \r\n\r\n“That I never did!” said Tom. “It was you.” \r\n\r\n“Two to one, so shut yer mouth!” said Bert. \r\n\r\n“Who are you a-talkin’ to?” said William. \r\n\r\n“Now stop it!” said Tom and Bert together. “The night’s gettin’ on, and dawn comes early. Let’s \r\nget on with it!” \r\n\r\n“Dawn take you all, and be stone to you!” said a voice that sounded like William’s. But it wasn’t. \r\nFor just at that moment the light came over the hill, and there was a mighty twitter in the branches. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam never spoke for he stood turned to stone as he stooped; and Bert and Tom were stuck like \r\nrocks as they looked at him. And there they stand to this day, all alone, unless the birds perch on them; \r\nfor trolls, as you probably know, must be underground before dawn, or they go back to the stuff of the \r\nmountains they are made of, and never move again. That is what had happened to Bert and Tom and \r\nWilliam. \r\n\r\n“Excellent!” said Gandalf, as he stepped from behind a tree, and helped Bilbo to climb down out of \r\na thorn-bush. Then Bilbo understood. It was the wizard’s voice that had kept the trolls bickering and \r\nquarrelling, until the light came and made an end of them. \r\n\r\nThe next thing was to untie the sacks and let out the dwarves. They were nearly suffocated, and \r\nvery annoyed: they had not at all enjoyed lying there listening to the trolls making plans for roasting \r\nthem and squashing them and mincing them. They had to hear Bilbo’s account of what had happened \r\nto him twice over, before they were satisfied. \r\n\r\n“Silly time to go practising pinching and pocket-picking,” said Bombur, “when what we wanted \r\nwas fire and food!” \r\n\r\n“And that’s just what you wouldn’t have got of those fellows without a struggle, in any case,” said \r\nGandalf. “Anyhow you are wasting time now. Don’t you realize that the trolls must have a cave or a \r\nhole dug somewhere near to hide from the sun in? We must look into it!” \r\n\r\nThey searched about, and soon found the marks of trolls’ stony boots going away through the trees. \r\nThey followed the tracks up the hill, until hidden by bushes they came on a big door of stone leading \r\nto a cave. But they could not open it, not though they all pushed while Gandalf tried various \r\nincantations. \r\n\r\n“Would this be any good?” asked Bilbo, when they were getting tired and angry. “I found it on the \r\nground where the trolls had their fight.” He held out a largish key, though no doubt William had \r\nthought it very small and secret. It must have fallen out of his pocket, very luckily, before he was \r\nturned to stone. \r\n\r\n“Why on earth didn’t you mention it before?” they cried. Gandalf grabbed it and fitted it into the \r\nkeyhole. Then the stone door swung back with one big push, and they all went inside. There were \r\nbones on the floor and a nasty smell was in the air; but there was a good deal of food jumbled \r\ncarelessly on shelves and on the ground, among an untidy litter of plunder, of all sorts from brass \r\nbuttons to pots full of gold coins standing in a corner. There were lots of clothes, too, hanging on the \r\nwalls — too small for trolls, I am afraid they belonged to victims — and among them were several \r\nswords of various makes, shapes, and sizes. Two caught their eyes particularly, because of their \r\nbeautiful scabbards and jewelled hilts. \r\n\r\nGandalf and Thorin each took one of these; and Bilbo took a knife in a leather sheath. It would \r\nhave made only a tiny pocket-knife for a troll, but it was as good as a short sword for the hobbit. \r\n\r\n“These look like good blades,” said the wizard, half drawing them and looking at them curiously. \r\n“They were not made by any troll, nor by any smith among men in these parts and days; but when we \r\ncan read the runes on them, we shall know more about them.” \r\n\r\n“Let’s get out of this horrible smell!” said Fili. So they carried out the pots of coins, and such food \r\nas was untouched and looked fit to eat, also one barrel of ale which was still full. By that time they felt \r\nlike breakfast, and being very hungry they did not turn their noses up at what they had got from the \r\ntrolls’ larder. Their own provisions were very scanty. Now they had bread and cheese, and plenty of \r\nale, and bacon to toast in the embers of the fire. \r\n\r\nAfter that they slept, for their night had been disturbed; and they did nothing more till the \r\nafternoon. Then they brought up their ponies, and carried away the pots of gold, and buried them very \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsecretly not far from the track by the river, putting a great many spells over them, just in case they \r\never had the chance to come back and recover them. When that was done, they all mounted once more, \r\nand jogged along again on the path towards the East. \r\n\r\n“Where did you go to, if I may ask?” said Thorin to Gandalf as they rode along. \r\n\r\n“To look ahead,” said he. \r\n\r\n“And what brought you back in the nick of time?” “Looking behind,” said he. \r\n\r\n“Exactly!” said Thorin; “but could you be more plain?” \r\n\r\n“I went on to spy out our road. It will soon become dangerous and difficult. Also I was anxious \r\nabout replenishing our small stock of provisions. I had not gone very far, however, when I met a \r\ncouple of friends of mine from Rivendell.” \r\n\r\n“Where’s that?” asked Bilbo. \r\n\r\n“Don’t interrupt!” said Gandalf. “You will get there in a few days now, if we’re lucky, and find out \r\nall about it. As I was saying I met two of Elrond’s people. They were hurrying along for fear of the \r\ntrolls. It was they who told me that three of them had come down from the mountains and settled in \r\nthe woods not far from the road: they had frightened everyone away from the district, and they \r\nwaylaid strangers. \r\n\r\n“I immediately had a feeling that I was wanted back. Looking behind I saw a fire in the distance \r\nand made for it. So now you know. Please be more careful, next time, or we shall never get \r\nanywhere ! ” \r\n\r\n“Thank you!” said Thorin."

    "ChapterData": "They did not sing or tell stories that day, even though the weather improved; nor the next day, nor the \r\nday after. They had begun to feel that danger was not far away on either side. They camped under the \r\nstars, and their horses had more to eat than they had; for there was plenty of grass, but there was not \r\nmuch in their bags, even with what they had got from the trolls. One morning they forded a river at a \r\nwide shallow place full of the noise of stones and foam. The far bank was steep and slippery. When \r\nthey got to the top of it, leading their ponies, they saw that the great mountains had marched down \r\nvery near to them. Already they seemed only a day’s easy journey from the feet of the nearest. Dark \r\nand drear it looked, though there were patches of sunlight on its brown sides, and behind its shoulders \r\nthe tips of snow-peaks gleamed. \r\n\r\n“Is that The Mountain?” asked Bilbo in a solemn voice, looking at it with round eyes. He had never \r\nseen a thing that looked so big before. \r\n\r\n“Of course not!” said Balin. “That is only the beginning of the Misty Mountains, and we have got \r\nto get through, or over, or under those somehow, before we can come into Wilderland beyond. And it \r\nis a deal of a way even from the other side of them to the Lonely Mountain in the East where Smaug \r\nlies on our treasure.” \r\n\r\n“O!” said Bilbo, and just at that moment he felt more tired than he ever remembered feeling \r\nbefore. He was thinking once again of his comfortable chair before the fire in his favourite sitting- \r\nroom in his hobbit-hole, and of the kettle singing. Not for the last time! \r\n\r\n\r\nNow Gandalf led the way. “We must not miss the road, or we shall be done for,” he said. “We need \r\nfood, for one thing, and rest in reasonable safety — also it is very necessary to tackle the Misty \r\nMountains by the proper path, or else you will get lost in them, and have to come back and start at the \r\nbeginning again (if you ever get back at all).” \r\n\r\nThey asked him where he was making for, and he answered: “You are come to the very edge of the \r\nWild, as some of you may know. Hidden somewhere ahead of us is the fair valley of Rivendell where \r\nElrond lives in the Last Homely House. I sent a message by my friends, and we are expected.” \r\n\r\nThat sounded nice and comforting, but they had not got there yet, and it was not so easy as it \r\nsounds to find the Last Homely House west of the Mountains. There seemed to be no trees and no \r\nvalleys and no hills to break the ground in front of them, only one vast slope going slowly up and up to \r\nmeet the feet of the nearest mountain, a wide land the colour of heather and crumbling rock, with \r\npatches and slashes of grass-green and moss-green showing where water might be. \r\n\r\nMorning passed, afternoon came; but in all the silent waste there was no sign of any dwelling. They \r\nwere growing anxious, for they saw now that the house might be hidden almost anywhere between \r\nthem and the mountains. They came on unexpected valleys, narrow with steep sides, that opened \r\nsuddenly at their feet, and they looked down surprised to see trees below them and running water at \r\nthe bottom. There were gullies that they could almost leap over, but very deep with waterfalls in them. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere were dark ravines that one could neither jump over nor climb into. There were bogs, some of \r\nthem green pleasant places to look at, with flowers growing bright and tall; but a pony that walked \r\nthere with a pack on its back would never have come out again. \r\n\r\nIt was indeed a much wider land from the ford to the mountains than ever you would have guessed. \r\nBilbo was astonished. The only path was marked with white stones, some of which were small, and \r\nothers were half covered with moss or heather. Altogether it was a very slow business following the \r\ntrack, even guided by Gandalf, who seemed to know his way about pretty well. \r\n\r\nHis head and beard wagged this way and that as he looked for the stones, and they followed his \r\nlead, but they seemed no nearer to the end of the search when the day began to fail. Tea-time had long \r\ngone by, and it seemed supper-time would soon do the same. There were moths fluttering about, and \r\nthe light became very dim, for the moon had not risen. Bilbo’s pony began to stumble over roots and \r\nstones. They came to the edge of a steep fall in the ground so suddenly that Gandalf’ s horse nearly \r\nslipped down the slope. \r\n\r\n“Here it is at last!” he called, and the others gathered round him and looked over the edge. They \r\nsaw a valley far below. They could hear the voice of hurrying water in a rocky bed at the bottom; the \r\nscent of trees was in the air; and there was a light on the valley-side across the water. \r\n\r\nBilbo never forgot the way they slithered and slipped in the dusk down the steep zig-zag path into \r\nthe secret valley of Rivendell. The air grew warmer as they got lower, and the smell of the pine-trees \r\nmade him drowsy, so that every now and again he nodded and nearly fell off, or bumped his nose on \r\nthe pony’s neck. Their spirits rose as they went down and down. The trees changed to beech and oak, \r\nand there was a comfortable feeling in the twilight. The last green had almost faded out of the grass, \r\nwhen they came at length to an open glade not far above the banks of the stream. \r\n\r\n“Hmmm! it smells like elves!” thought Bilbo, and he looked up at the stars. They were burning \r\nbright and blue. Just then there came a burst of song like laughter in the trees: \r\n\r\n\r\nO! What are you doing, \r\n\r\nAnd where are you going? \r\nYour ponies need shoeing! \r\nThe river is flowing! \r\n\r\nO! tra-la-la-lally \r\n\r\nhere down in the valley! \r\n\r\n\r\nO! What are you seeking, \r\nAnd where are you making? \r\nThe faggots are reeking, \r\n\r\nThe bannocks are baking! \r\nO! tril-lil-lil-lolly \r\nthe valley is jolly, \r\nha! ha! \r\n\r\n\r\nO! Where are you going \r\nWith beards all a-wagging? \r\nNo knowing, no knowing \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat brings Mister Baggins \r\nAnd Balin and Dwalin \r\ndown into the valley \r\nin June \r\nha! ha! \r\n\r\n\r\nO! Will you be staying, \r\n\r\nOr will you be flying? \r\n\r\nYour ponies are straying! \r\nThe daylight is dying! \r\n\r\nTo fly would be folly, \r\n\r\nTo stay would be jolly \r\nAnd listen and hark \r\nTill the end of the dark \r\nto our tune \r\nha! ha! \r\n\r\n\r\nSo they laughed and sang in the trees; and pretty fair nonsense I daresay you think it. Not that they \r\nwould care; they would only laugh all the more if you told them so. They were elves of course. Soon \r\nBilbo caught glimpses of them as the darkness deepened. He loved elves, though he seldom met them; \r\nbut he was a little frightened of them too. Dwarves don’t get on well with them. Even decent enough \r\ndwarves like Thorin and his friends think them foolish (which is a very foolish thing to think), or get \r\nannoyed with them. For some elves tease them and laugh at them, and most of all at their beards. \r\n\r\n“Well, well!” said a voice. “Just look! Bilbo the hobbit on a pony, my dear! Isn’t it delicious!” \r\n\r\n“Most astonishing wonderful!” \r\n\r\nThen off they went into another song as ridiculous as the one I have written down in full. At last \r\none, a tall young fellow, came out from the trees and bowed to Gandalf and to Thorin. \r\n\r\n“Welcome to the valley!” he said. \r\n\r\n“Thank you!” said Thorin a bit gruffly; but Gandalf was already off his horse and among the elves, \r\ntalking merrily with them. \r\n\r\n“You are a little out of your way,” said the elf: “that is, if you are making for the only path across \r\nthe water and to the house beyond. We will set you right, but you had best get on foot, until you are \r\nover the bridge. Are you going to stay a bit and sing with us, or will you go straight on? Supper is \r\npreparing over there,” he said. “I can smell the wood-fires for the cooking.” \r\n\r\nTired as he was, Bilbo would have liked to stay a while. Elvish singing is not a thing to miss, in \r\nJune under the stars, not if you care for such things. Also he would have liked to have a few private \r\nwords with these people that seemed to know his names and all about him, although he had never seen \r\nthem before. He thought their opinion of his adventure might be interesting. Elves know a lot and are \r\nwondrous folk for news, and know what is going on among the peoples of the land, as quick as water \r\nflows, or quicker. \r\n\r\nBut the dwarves were all for supper as soon as possible just then, and would not stay. On they all \r\nwent, leading their ponies, till they were brought to a good path and so at last to the very brink of the \r\nriver. It was flowing fast and noisily, as mountain-streams do of a summer evening, when sun has \r\nbeen all day on the snow far up above. There was only a narrow bridge of stone without a parapet, as \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnarrow as a pony could well walk on; and over that they had to go, slow and careful, one by one, each \r\nleading his pony by the bridle. The elves had brought bright lanterns to the shore, and they sang a \r\nmerry song as the party went across. \r\n\r\n“Don’t dip your beard in the foam, father!” they cried to Thorin, who was bent almost on to his \r\nhands and knees. “It is long enough without watering it.” \r\n\r\n“Mind Bilbo doesn’t eat all the cakes!” they called. “He is too fat to get through key-holes yet!” \r\n“Hush, hush! Good People! and good night!” said Gandalf, who came last. “Valleys have ears, and \r\nsome elves have over merry tongues. Good night!” \r\n\r\nAnd so at last they all came to the Last Homely House, and found its doors flung wide. \r\n\r\n\r\nNow it is a strange thing, but things that are good to have and days that are good to spend are soon \r\ntold about, and not much to listen to; while things that are uncomfortable, palpitating, and even \r\ngruesome, may make a good tale, and take a deal of telling anyway. They stayed long in that good \r\nhouse, fourteen days at least, and they found it hard to leave. Bilbo would gladly have stopped there \r\nfor ever and ever — even supposing a wish would have taken him right back to his hobbit-hole without \r\ntrouble. Yet there is little to tell about their stay. \r\n\r\nThe master of the house was an elf-friend — one of those people whose fathers came into the \r\nstrange stories before the beginning of History, the wars of the evil goblins and the elves and the first \r\nmen in the North. In those days of our tale there were still some people who had both elves and heroes \r\nof the North for ancestors, and Elrond the master of the house was their chief. \r\n\r\nHe was as noble and as fair in face as an elf-lord, as strong as a warrior, as wise as a wizard, as \r\nvenerable as a king of dwarves, and as kind as summer. He comes into many tales, but his part in the \r\nstory of Bilbo’s great adventure is only a small one, though important, as you will see, if we ever get \r\nto the end of it. His house was perfect, whether you liked food, or sleep, or work, or story-telling, or \r\nsinging, or just sitting and thinking best, or a pleasant mixture of them all. Evil things did not come \r\ninto that valley. \r\n\r\nI wish I had time to tell you even a few of the tales or one or two of the songs that they heard in \r\nthat house. All of them, the ponies as well, grew refreshed and strong in a few days there. Their \r\nclothes were mended as well as their bruises, their tempers and their hopes. Their bags were filled \r\nwith food and provisions light to carry but strong to bring them over the mountain passes. Their plans \r\nwere improved with the best advice. So the time came to midsummer eve, and they were to go on \r\nagain with the early sun on midsummer morning. \r\n\r\nElrond knew all about runes of every kind. That day he looked at the swords they had brought from \r\nthe trolls’ lair, and he said: “These are not troll-make. They are old swords, very old swords of the \r\nHigh Elves of the West, my kin. They were made in Gondolin for the Goblin-wars. They must have \r\ncome from a dragon’s hoard or goblin plunder, for dragons and goblins destroyed that city many ages \r\nago. This, Thorin, the runes name Orcrist, the Goblin-cleaver in the ancient tongue of Gondolin; it was \r\na famous blade. This, Gandalf, was Glamdring, Foe-hammer that the king of Gondolin once wore. \r\nKeep them well!” \r\n\r\n“Whence did the trolls get them, I wonder?” said Thorin looking at his sword with new interest. \r\n\r\n“I could not say,” said Elrond, “but one may guess that your trolls had plundered other plunderers, \r\nor come on the remnants of old robberies in some hold in the mountains. I have heard that there are \r\nstill forgotten treasures of old to be found in the deserted caverns of the mines of Moria, since the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndwarf and goblin war.” \r\n\r\nThorin pondered these words. “I will keep this sword in honour,” he said. “May it soon cleave \r\ngoblins once again!” \r\n\r\n“A wish that is likely to be granted soon enough in the mountains!” said Elrond. “But show me now \r\nyour map!” \r\n\r\nHe took it and gazed long at it, and he shook his head; for if he did not altogether approve of \r\ndwarves and their love of gold, he hated dragons and their cruel wickedness, and he grieved to \r\nremember the ruin of the town of Dale and its merry bells, and the burned banks of the bright River \r\nRunning. The moon was shining in a broad silver crescent. He held up the map and the white light \r\nshone through it. “What is this?” he said. “There are moon-letters here, beside the plain runes which \r\nsay ‘five feet high the door and three may walk abreast.’” \r\n\r\n“What are moon-letters?” asked the hobbit full of excitement. He loved maps, as I have told you \r\nbefore; and he also liked runes and letters and cunning handwriting, though when he wrote himself it \r\nwas a bit thin and spidery. \r\n\r\n“Moon-letters are rune-letters, but you cannot see them,” said Elrond, “not when you look straight \r\nat them. They can only be seen when the moon shines behind them, and what is more, with the more \r\ncunning sort it must be a moon of the same shape and season as the day when they were written. The \r\ndwarves invented them and wrote them with silver pens, as your friends could tell you. These must \r\nhave been written on a midsummer’s eve in a crescent moon, a long while ago.” \r\n\r\n“What do they say?” asked Gandalf and Thorin together, a bit vexed perhaps that even Elrond \r\nshould have found this out first, though really there had not been a chance before, and there would not \r\nhave been another until goodness knows when. \r\n\r\n“ Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks. ” read Elrond, “and the setting sun with the last \r\nlight of Durin’s Day will shine upon the key-hole.” \r\n\r\n“Durin, Durin!” said Thorin. “He was the father of the fathers of the eldest race of Dwarves, the \r\nLongbeards, and my first ancestor: I am his heir.” \r\n\r\n“Then what is Durin’s Day?” asked Elrond. \r\n\r\n“The first day of the dwarves’ New Year,” said Thorin, “is as all should know the first day of the \r\nlast moon of Autumn on the threshold of Winter. We still call it Durin’s Day when the last moon of \r\nAutumn and the sun are in the sky together. But this will not help us much, I fear, for it passes our \r\nskill in these days to guess when such a time will come again.” \r\n\r\n“That remains to be seen,” said Gandalf. “Is there any more writing?” \r\n\r\n“None to be seen by this moon,” said Elrond, and he gave the map back to Thorin; and then they \r\nwent down to the water to see the elves dance and sing upon the midsummer’s eve. \r\n\r\nThe next morning was a midsummer’s morning as fair and fresh as could be dreamed: blue sky and \r\nnever a cloud, and the sun dancing on the water. Now they rode away amid songs of farewell and good \r\nspeed, with their hearts ready for more adventure, and with a knowledge of the road they must follow \r\nover the Misty Mountains to the land beyond."

    "ChapterData": "There were many paths that led up into those mountains, and many passes over them. But most of the \r\npaths were cheats and deceptions and led nowhere or to bad ends; and most of the passes were infested \r\nby evil things and dreadful dangers. The dwarves and the hobbit, helped by the wise advice of Elrond \r\nand the knowledge and memory of Gandalf, took the right road to the right pass. \r\n\r\nLong days after they had climbed out of the valley and left the Last Homely House miles behind, \r\nthey were still going up and up and up. It was a hard path and a dangerous path, a crooked way and a \r\nlonely and a long. Now they could look back over the lands they had left, laid out behind them far \r\nbelow. Lar, far away in the West, where things were blue and faint, Bilbo knew there lay his own \r\ncountry of safe and comfortable things, and his little hobbit-hole. He shivered. It was getting bitter \r\ncold up here, and the wind came shrill among the rocks. Boulders, too, at times came galloping down \r\nthe mountain-sides, let loose by mid-day sun upon the snow, and passed among them (which was \r\nlucky), or over their heads (which was alarming). The nights were comfortless and chill, and they did \r\nnot dare to sing or talk too loud, for the echoes were uncanny, and the silence seemed to dislike being \r\nbroken — except by the noise of water and the wail of wind and the crack of stone. \r\n\r\n“The summer is getting on down below,” thought Bilbo, “and haymaking is going on and picnics. \r\nThey will be harvesting and blackberrying, before we even begin to go down the other side at this \r\nrate.” And the others were thinking equally gloomy thoughts, although when they had said good-bye to \r\nElrond in the high hope of a midsummer morning, they had spoken gaily of the passage of the \r\nmountains, and of riding swift across the lands beyond. They had thought of coming to the secret door \r\nin the Lonely Mountain, perhaps that very next last moon of Autumn — “and perhaps it will be Durin’s \r\nDay” they had said. Only Gandalf had shaken his head and said nothing. Dwarves had not passed that \r\nway for many years, but Gandalf had, and he knew how evil and danger had grown and thriven in the \r\nWild, since the dragons had driven men from the lands, and the goblins had spread in secret after the \r\nbattle of the Mines of Moria. Even the good plans of wise wizards like Gandalf and of good friends \r\nlike Elrond go astray sometimes when you are off on dangerous adventures over the Edge of the Wild; \r\nand Gandalf was a wise enough wizard to know it. \r\n\r\n\r\nHe knew that something unexpected might happen, and he hardly dared to hope that they would pass \r\nwithout fearful adventure over those great tall mountains with lonely peaks and valleys where no king \r\nruled. They did not. All was well, until one day they met a thunderstorm — more than a thunderstorm, a \r\nthunder-battle. You know how terrific a really big thunderstorm can be down in the land and in a \r\nriver-valley; especially at times when two great thunderstorms meet and clash. More terrible still are \r\nthunder and lightning in the mountains at night, when storms come up from East and West and make \r\nwar. The lightning splinters on the peaks, and rocks shiver, and great crashes split the air and go \r\nrolling and tumbling into every cave and hollow; and the darkness is filled with overwhelming noise \r\nand sudden light. \r\n\r\n\r\nBilbo had never seen or imagined anything of the kind. They were high up in a narrow place, with a \r\ndreadful fall into a dim valley at one side of them. There they were sheltering under a hanging rock for \r\nthe night, and he lay beneath a blanket and shook from head to toe. When he peeped out in the \r\nlightning-flashes, he saw that across the valley the stone-giants were out, and were hurling rocks at \r\none another for a game, and catching them, and tossing them down into the darkness where they \r\nsmashed among the trees far below, or splintered into little bits with a bang. Then came a wind and a \r\nrain, and the wind whipped the rain and the hail about in every direction, so that an overhanging rock \r\nwas no protection at all. Soon they were getting drenched and their ponies were standing with their \r\nheads down and their tails between their legs, and some of them were whinnying with fright. They \r\ncould hear the giants guffawing and shouting all over the mountainsides. \r\n\r\n“This won’t do at all!” said Thorin. “If we don’t get blown off, or drowned, or struck by lightning, \r\nwe shall be picked up by some giant and kicked sky-high for a football.” \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mountain-path \r\n\r\n\r\n“Well, if you know of anywhere better, take us there!” said Gandalf, who was feeling very grumpy, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand was far from happy about the giants himself. \r\n\r\nThe end of their argument was that they sent Fili and Kili to look for a better shelter. They had very \r\nsharp eyes, and being the youngest of the dwarves by some fifty years they usually got these sort of \r\njobs (when everybody could see that it was absolutely no use sending Bilbo). There is nothing like \r\nlooking, if you want to find something (or so Thorin said to the young dwarves). You certainly usually \r\nfind something, if you look, but it is not always quite the something you were after. So it proved on \r\nthis occasion. \r\n\r\nSoon Fili and Kili came crawling back, holding on to the rocks in the wind. “We have found a dry \r\ncave,” they said, “not far round the next corner; and ponies and all could get inside.” \r\n\r\n“Have you thoroughly explored it?” said the wizard, who knew that caves up in the mountains were \r\nseldom unoccupied. \r\n\r\n“Yes, yes!” they said, though everybody knew they could not have been long about it; they had \r\ncome back too quick. “It isn’t all that big, and it does not go far back.” \r\n\r\nThat, of course, is the dangerous part about caves: you don’t know how far they go back, \r\nsometimes, or where a passage behind may lead to, or what is waiting for you inside. But now Fili and \r\nKili’s news seemed good enough. So they all got up and prepared to move. The wind was howling and \r\nthe thunder still growling, and they had a business getting themselves and their ponies along. Still it \r\nwas not very far to go, and before long they came to a big rock standing out into the path. If you \r\nstepped behind, you found a low arch in the side of the mountain. There was just room to get the \r\nponies through with a squeeze, when they had been unpacked and unsaddled. As they passed under the \r\narch, it was good to hear the wind and the rain outside instead of all about them, and to feel safe from \r\nthe giants and their rocks. But the wizard was taking no risks. He lit up his wand — as he did that day in \r\nBilbo’s dining-room that seemed so long ago, if you remember — , and by its light they explored the \r\ncave from end to end. \r\n\r\nIt seemed quite a fair size, but not too large and mysterious. It had a dry floor and some \r\ncomfortable nooks. At one end there was room for the ponies; and there they stood (mighty glad of the \r\nchange) steaming, and champing in their nosebags. Oin and Gloin wanted to light a fire at the door to \r\ndry their clothes, but Gandalf would not hear of it. So they spread out their wet things on the floor, and \r\ngot dry ones out of their bundles; then they made their blankets comfortable, got out their pipes and \r\nblew smoke rings, which Gandalf turned into different colours and set dancing up by the roof to amuse \r\nthem. They talked and talked, and forgot about the storm, and discussed what each would do with his \r\nshare of the treasure (when they got it, which at the moment did not seem so impossible); and so they \r\ndropped off to sleep one by one. And that was the last time that they used the ponies, packages, \r\nbaggages, tools and paraphernalia that they had brought with them. \r\n\r\nIt turned out a good thing that night that they had brought little Bilbo with them, after all. For, \r\nsomehow, he could not go to sleep for a long while; and when he did sleep, he had very nasty dreams. \r\nHe dreamed that a crack in the wall at the back of the cave got bigger and bigger, and opened wider \r\nand wider, and he was very afraid but could not call out or do anything but lie and look. Then he \r\ndreamed that the floor of the cave was giving way, and he was slipping — beginning to fall down, \r\ndown, goodness knows where to. \r\n\r\nAt that he woke up with a horrible start, and found that part of his dream was true. A crack had \r\nopened at the back of the cave, and was already a wide passage. He was just in time to see the last of \r\nthe ponies’ tails disappearing into it. Of course he gave a very loud yell, as loud a yell as a hobbit can \r\ngive, which is surprising for their size. \r\n\r\nOut jumped the goblins, big goblins, great ugly-looking goblins, lots of goblins, before you could \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsay rocks and blocks. There were six to each dwarf, at least, and two even for Bilbo; and they were all \r\ngrabbed and carried through the crack, before you could say tinder and flint. But not Gandalf. Bilbo’s \r\nyell had done that much good. It had wakened him up wide in a splintered second, and when goblins \r\ncame to grab him, there was a terrific flash like lightning in the cave, a smell like gunpowder, and \r\nseveral of them fell dead. \r\n\r\nThe crack closed with a snap, and Bilbo and the dwarves were on the wrong side of it! Where was \r\nGandalf? Of that neither they nor the goblins had any idea, and the goblins did not wait to find out. \r\nThey seized Bilbo and the dwarves and hurried them along. It was deep, deep, dark, such as only \r\ngoblins that have taken to living in the heart of the mountains can see through. The passages there \r\nwere crossed and tangled in all directions, but the goblins knew their way, as well as you do to the \r\nnearest post-office; and the way went down and down, and it was most horribly stuffy. The goblins \r\nwere very rough, and pinched unmercifully, and chuckled and laughed in their horrible stony voices; \r\nand Bilbo was more unhappy even than when the troll had picked him up by his toes. He wished again \r\nand again for his nice bright hobbit-hole. Not for the last time. \r\n\r\nNow there came a glimmer of a red light before them. The goblins began to sing, or croak, keeping \r\ntime with the flap of their flat feet on the stone, and shaking their prisoners as well. \r\n\r\n\r\nClap! Snap! the black crack! \r\nGrip, grab! Pinch, nab! \r\n\r\nAnd down down to Goblin-town \r\nYou go, my lad! \r\n\r\n\r\nClash, crash! Crush, smash! \r\n\r\nHammer and tongs! Knocker and gongs! Pound, pound, far underground! \r\nHo, ho! my lad! \r\n\r\n\r\nSwish, smack! Whip crack! \r\n\r\nBatter and beat! Yammer and bleat! Work, work! Nor dare to shirk, \r\n\r\nWhile Goblins quaff, and Goblins laugh, Round and round far underground \r\nBelow, my lad! \r\n\r\n\r\nIt sounded truly terrifying. The walls echoed to the clap, snap! and the crush, smash ! and to the \r\nugly laughter of their ho, ho! my lad! The general meaning of the song was only too plain; for now the \r\ngoblins took out whips and whipped them with a swish, smack!, and set them running as fast as they \r\ncould in front of them; and more than one of the dwarves were already yammering and bleating like \r\nanything, when they stumbled into a big cavern. \r\n\r\nIt was lit by a great red fire in the middle, and by torches along the walls, and it was full of goblins. \r\nThey all laughed and stamped and clapped their hands, when the dwarves (with poor little Bilbo at the \r\nback and nearest to the whips) came running in, while the goblin-drivers whooped and cracked their \r\nwhips behind. The ponies were already there huddled in a corner; and there were all the baggages and \r\npackages lying broken open, and being rummaged by goblins, and smelt by goblins, and fingered by \r\ngoblins, and quarrelled over by goblins. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am afraid that was the last they ever saw of those excellent little ponies, including a jolly sturdy \r\nlittle white fellow that Elrond had lent to Gandalf, since his horse was not suitable for the mountain- \r\npaths. For goblins eat horses and ponies and donkeys (and other much more dreadful things), and they \r\nare always hungry. Just now however the prisoners were thinking only of themselves. The goblins \r\nchained their hands behind their backs and linked them all together in a line, and dragged them to the \r\nfar end of the cavern with little Bilbo tugging at the end of the row. \r\n\r\nThere in the shadows on a large flat stone sat a tremendous goblin with a huge head, and armed \r\ngoblins were standing round him carrying the axes and the bent swords that they use. Now goblins are \r\ncruel, wicked, and bad-hearted. They make no beautiful things, but they make many clever ones. They \r\ncan tunnel and mine as well as any but the most skilled dwarves, when they take the trouble, though \r\nthey are usually untidy and dirty. Hammers, axes, swords, daggers, pickaxes, tongs, and also \r\ninstruments of torture, they make very well, or get other people to make to their design, prisoners and \r\nslaves that have to work till they die for want of air and light. It is not unlikely that they invented \r\nsome of the machines that have since troubled the world, especially the ingenious devices for killing \r\nlarge numbers of people at once, for wheels and engines and explosions always delighted them, and \r\nalso not working with their own hands more than they could help; but in those days and those wild \r\nparts they had not advanced (as it is called) so far. They did not hate dwarves especially, no more than \r\nthey hated everybody and everything, and particularly the orderly and prosperous; in some parts \r\nwicked dwarves had even made alliances with them. But they had a special grudge against Thorin’ s \r\npeople, because of the war which you have heard mentioned, but which does not come into this tale; \r\nand anyway goblins don’t care who they catch, as long as it is done smart and secret, and the prisoners \r\nare not able to defend themselves. \r\n\r\n“Who are these miserable persons?” said the Great Goblin. \r\n\r\n“Dwarves, and this!” said one of the drivers, pulling at Bilbo’s chain so that he fell forward onto \r\nhis knees. “We found them sheltering in our Front Porch.” \r\n\r\n“What do you mean by it?” said the Great Goblin turning to Thorin. “Up to no good, I’ll warrant! \r\nSpying on the private business of my people, I guess! Thieves, I shouldn’t be surprised to learn! \r\nMurderers and friends of Elves, not unlikely! Come! What have you got to say?” \r\n\r\n“Thorin the dwarf at your service!” he replied — it was merely a polite nothing. “Of the things \r\nwhich you suspect and imagine we had no idea at all. We sheltered from a storm in what seemed a \r\nconvenient cave and unused; nothing was further from our thoughts than inconveniencing goblins in \r\nany way whatever.” That was true enough! \r\n\r\n“Um!” said the Great Goblin. “So you say! Might I ask what you were doing up in the mountains at \r\nall, and where you were coming from, and where you were going to? In fact I should like to know all \r\nabout you. Not that it will do you much good, Thorin Oakenshield, I know too much about your folk \r\nalready; but let’s have the truth, or I will prepare something particularly uncomfortable for you!” \r\n\r\n“We were on a journey to visit our relatives, our nephews and nieces, and first, second, and third \r\ncousins, and the other descendants of our grandfathers, who live on the East side of these truly \r\nhospitable mountains,” said Thorin, not quite knowing what to say all at once in a moment, when \r\nobviously the exact truth would not do at all. \r\n\r\n“He is a liar, O truly tremendous one!” said one of the drivers. “Several of our people were struck \r\nby lightning in the cave, when we invited these creatures to come below; and they are as dead as \r\nstones. Also he has not explained this!” He held out the sword which Thorin had worn, the sword \r\nwhich came from the Trolls’ lair. \r\n\r\nThe Great Goblin gave a truly awful howl of rage when he looked at it, and all his soldiers gnashed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir teeth, clashed their shields, and stamped. They knew the sword at once. It had killed hundreds of \r\ngoblins in its time, when the fair elves of Gondolin hunted them in the hills or did battle before their \r\nwalls. They had called it Orcrist, Goblin-cleaver, but the goblins called it simply Biter. They hated it \r\nand hated worse any one that carried it. \r\n\r\n“Murderers and elf-friends!” the Great Goblin shouted. “Slash them! Beat them! Bite them! Gnash \r\nthem! Take them away to dark holes full of snakes, and never let them see the light again!” He was in \r\nsuch a rage that he jumped off his seat and himself rushed at Thorin with his mouth open. \r\n\r\nJust at that moment all the lights in the cavern went out, and the great fire went off poof! into a \r\ntower of blue glowing smoke, right up to the roof, that scattered piercing white sparks all among the \r\ngoblins. \r\n\r\nThe yells and yammering, croaking, jibbering and jabbering; howls, growls and curses; shrieking \r\nand skriking, that followed were beyond description. Several hundred wild cats and wolves being \r\nroasted slowly alive together would not have compared with it. The sparks were burning holes in the \r\ngoblins, and the smoke that now fell from the roof made the air too thick for even their eyes to see \r\nthrough. Soon they were falling over one another and rolling in heaps on the floor, biting and kicking \r\nand fighting as if they had all gone mad. \r\n\r\nSuddenly a sword flashed in its own light. Bilbo saw it go right through the Great Goblin as he \r\nstood dumbfounded in the middle of his rage. He fell dead, and the goblin soldiers fled before the \r\nsword shrieking into the darkness. \r\n\r\nThe sword went back into its sheath. “Follow me quick!” said a voice fierce and quiet; and before \r\nBilbo understood what had happened he was trotting along again, as fast as he could trot, at the end of \r\nthe line, down more dark passages with the yells of the goblin-hall growing fainter behind him. A pale \r\nlight was leading them on. \r\n\r\n“Quicker, quicker!” said the voice. “The torches will soon be relit.” \r\n\r\n“Half a minute!” said Dori, who was at the back next to Bilbo, and a decent fellow. He made the \r\nhobbit scramble on his shoulders as best he could with his tied hands, and then off they all went at a \r\nrun, with a clink-clink of chains, and many a stumble, since they had no hands to steady themselves \r\nwith. Not for a long while did they stop, and by that time they must have been right down in the very \r\nmountain’s heart. \r\n\r\nThen Gandalf lit up his wand. Of course it was Gandalf; but just then they were too busy to ask how \r\nhe got there. He took out his sword again, and again it flashed in the dark by itself. It burned with a \r\nrage that made it gleam if goblins were about; now it was bright as blue flame for delight in the killing \r\nof the great lord of the cave. It made no trouble whatever of cutting through the goblin-chains and \r\nsetting all the prisoners free as quickly as possible. This sword’s name was Glamdring the Foe- \r\nhammer, if you remember. The goblins just called it Beater, and hated it worse than Biter if possible. \r\nOrcrist, too, had been saved; for \r\n\r\nGandalf had brought it along as well, snatching it from one of the terrified guards. Gandalf thought \r\nof most things; and though he could not do everything, he could do a great deal for friends in a tight \r\ncorner. \r\n\r\n“Are we all here?” said he, handing his sword back to Thorin with a bow. “Let me see: one — that’s \r\nThorin; two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven; where are Fili and Kili? Here they \r\nare! twelve, thirteen — and here’s Mr. Baggins: fourteen! Well, well! it might be worse, and then again \r\nit might be a good deal better. No ponies, and no food, and no knowing quite where we are, and hordes \r\nof angry goblins just behind! On we go!” \r\n\r\nOn they went. Gandalf was quite right: they began to hear goblin noises and horrible cries far \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbehind in the passages they had come through. That sent them on faster than ever, and as poor Bilbo \r\ncould not possibly go half as fast — for dwarves can roll along at a tremendous pace, I can tell you, \r\nwhen they have to — they took it in turn to carry him on their backs. \r\n\r\nStill goblins go faster than dwarves, and these goblins knew the way better (they had made the \r\npaths themselves), and were madly angry; so that do what they could the dwarves heard the cries and \r\nhowls getting closer and closer. Soon they could hear even the flap of the goblin feet, many many feet \r\nwhich seemed only just round the last corner. The blink of red torches could be seen behind them in \r\nthe tunnel they were following; and they were getting deadly tired. \r\n\r\n“Why, O why did I ever leave my hobbit-hole!” said poor Mr. Baggins bumping up and down on \r\nBombur’s back. \r\n\r\n“Why, O why did I ever bring a wretched little hobbit on a treasure hunt!” said poor Bombur, who \r\nwas fat, and staggered along with the sweat dripping down his nose in his heat and terror. \r\n\r\nAt this point Gandalf fell behind, and Thorin with him. They turned a sharp corner. “About turn!” \r\nhe shouted. “Draw your sword Thorin!” \r\n\r\nThere was nothing else to be done; and the goblins did not like it. They came scurrying round the \r\ncorner in full cry, and found Goblin-cleaver, and Foe-hammer shining cold and bright right in their \r\nastonished eyes. The ones in front dropped their torches and gave one yell before they were killed. The \r\nones behind yelled still more, and leaped back knocking over those that were running after them. \r\n“Biter and Beater!” they shrieked; and soon they were all in confusion, and most of them were \r\nhustling back the way they had come. \r\n\r\nIt was quite a long while before any of them dared to turn that corner. By that time the dwarves had \r\ngone on again, a long, long, way on into the dark tunnels of the goblins’ realm. When the goblins \r\ndiscovered that, they put out their torches and they slipped on soft shoes, and they chose out their very \r\nquickest runners with the sharpest ears and eyes. These ran forward, as swift as weasels in the dark, \r\nand with hardly any more noise than bats. \r\n\r\nThat is why neither Bilbo, nor the dwarves, nor even Gandalf heard them coming. Nor did they see \r\nthem. But they were seen by the goblins that ran silently up behind, for Gandalf was letting his wand \r\ngive out a faint light to help the dwarves as they went along. \r\n\r\nQuite suddenly Dori, now at the back again carrying Bilbo, was grabbed from behind in the dark. \r\n\r\nHe shouted and fell; and the hobbit rolled off his shoulders into the blackness, bumped his head on \r\nhard rock, and remembered nothing more."

    "ChapterData": "When Bilbo opened his eyes, he wondered if he had; for it was just as dark as with them shut. No one \r\nwas anywhere near him. Just imagine his fright! He could hear nothing, see nothing, and he could feel \r\nnothing except the stone of the floor. \r\n\r\nVery slowly he got up and groped about on all fours, till he touched the wall of the tunnel; but \r\nneither up nor down it could he find anything: nothing at all, no sign of goblins, no sign of dwarves. \r\nHis head was swimming, and he was far from certain even of the direction they had been going in \r\nwhen he had his fall. He guessed as well as he could, and crawled along for a good way, till suddenly \r\nhis hand met what felt like a tiny ring of cold metal lying on the floor of the tunnel. It was a turning \r\npoint in his career, but he did not know it. He put the ring in his pocket almost without thinking; \r\ncertainly it did not seem of any particular use at the moment. He did not go much further, but sat down \r\non the cold floor and gave himself up to complete miserableness, for a long while. He thought of \r\nhimself frying bacon and eggs in his own kitchen at home — for he could feel inside that it was high \r\ntime for some meal or other; but that only made him miserabler. \r\n\r\nHe could not think what to do; nor could he think what had happened; or why he had been left \r\nbehind; or why, if he had been left behind, the goblins had not caught him; or even why his head was \r\nso sore. The truth was he had been lying quiet, out of sight and out of mind, in a very dark corner for a \r\nlong while. \r\n\r\nAfter some time he felt for his pipe. It was not broken, and that was something. Then he felt for his \r\npouch, and there was some tobacco in it, and that was something more. Then he felt for matches and \r\nhe could not find any at all, and that shattered his hopes completely. Just as well for him, as he agreed \r\nwhen he came to his senses. Goodness knows what the striking of matches and the smell of tobacco \r\nwould have brought on him out of dark holes in that horrible place. Still at the moment he felt very \r\ncrushed. But in slapping all his pockets and feeling all round himself for matches his hand came on \r\nthe hilt of his little sword — the little dagger that he got from the trolls, and that he had quite forgotten; \r\nnor fortunately had the goblins noticed it, as he wore it inside his breeches. \r\n\r\nNow he drew it out. It shone pale and dim before his eyes. “So it is an elvish blade, too,” he \r\nthought; “and goblins are not very near, and yet not far enough.” \r\n\r\nBut somehow he was comforted. It was rather splendid to be wearing a blade made in Gondolin for \r\nthe goblin-wars of which so many songs had sung; and also he had noticed that such weapons made a \r\ngreat impression on goblins that came upon them suddenly. \r\n\r\n“Go back?” he thought. “No good at all! Go sideways? Impossible! Go forward? Only thing to do! \r\nOn we go!” So up he got, and trotted along with his little sword held in front of him and one hand \r\nfeeling the wall, and his heart all of a patter and a pitter. \r\n\r\n\r\nNow certainly Bilbo was in what is called a tight place. But you must remember it was not quite so \r\ntight for him as it would have been for me or for you. Hobbits are not quite like ordinary people; and \r\n\r\n\r\nafter all if their holes are nice cheery places and properly aired, quite different from the tunnels of the \r\ngoblins, still they are more used to tunnelling than we are, and they do not easily lose their sense of \r\ndirection underground — not when their heads have recovered from being bumped. Also they can move \r\nvery quietly, and hide easily, and recover wonderfully from falls and bruises, and they have a fund of \r\nwisdom and wise sayings that men have mostly never heard or have forgotten long ago. \r\n\r\nI should not have liked to have been in Mr. Baggins’ place, all the same. The tunnel seemed to have \r\nno end. All he knew was that it was still going down pretty steadily and keeping in the same direction \r\nin spite of a twist and a turn or two. There were passages leading off to the side every now and then, as \r\nhe knew by the glimmer of his sword, or could feel with his hand on the wall. Of these he took no \r\nnotice, except to hurry past for fear of goblins or half-imagined dark things coming out of them. On \r\nand on he went, and down and down; and still he heard no sound of anything except the occasional \r\nwhirr of a bat by his ears, which startled him at first, till it became too frequent to bother about. I do \r\nnot know how long he kept on like this, hating to go on, not daring to stop, on, on, until he was tireder \r\nthan tired. It seemed like all the way to tomorrow and over it to the days beyond. \r\n\r\nSuddenly without any warning he trotted splash into water! Ugh! it was icy cold. That pulled him \r\nup sharp and short. He did not know whether it was just a pool in the path, or the edge of an \r\nunderground stream that crossed the passage, or the brink of a deep dark subterranean lake. The sword \r\nwas hardly shining at all. He stopped, and he could hear, when he listened hard, drops drip-drip- \r\ndripping from an unseen roof into the water below; but there seemed no other sort of sound. \r\n\r\n“So it is a pool or a lake, and not an underground river,” he thought. Still he did not dare to wade \r\nout into the darkness. He could not swim; and he thought, too, of nasty slimy things, with big bulging \r\nblind eyes, wriggling in the water. There are strange things living in the pools and lakes in the hearts \r\nof mountains: fish whose fathers swam in, goodness only knows how many years ago, and never swam \r\nout again, while their eyes grew bigger and bigger and bigger from trying to see in the blackness; also \r\nthere are other things more slimy than fish. Even in the tunnels and caves the goblins have made for \r\nthemselves there are other things living unbeknown to them that have sneaked in from outside to lie \r\nup in the dark. Some of these caves, too, go back in their beginnings to ages before the goblins, who \r\nonly widened them and joined them up with passages, and the original owners are still there in odd \r\ncorners, slinking and nosing about. \r\n\r\nDeep down here by the dark water lived old Gollum, a small slimy creature. I don’t know where he \r\ncame from, nor who or what he was. He was Gollum — as dark as darkness, except for two big round \r\npale eyes in his thin face. He had a little boat, and he rowed about quite quietly on the lake; for lake it \r\nwas, wide and deep and deadly cold. He paddled it with large feet dangling over the side, but never a \r\nripple did he make. Not he. He was looking out of his pale lamp-like eyes for blind fish, which he \r\ngrabbed with his long fingers as quick as thinking. He liked meat too. Goblin he thought good, when \r\nhe could get it; but he took care they never found him out. He just throttled them from behind, if they \r\never came down alone anywhere near the edge of the water, while he was prowling about. They very \r\nseldom did, for they had a feeling that something unpleasant was lurking down there, down at the very \r\nroots of the mountain. They had come on the lake, when they were tunnelling down long ago, and they \r\nfound they could go no further; so there their road ended in that direction, and there was no reason to \r\ngo that way — unless the Great Goblin sent them. Sometimes he took a fancy for fish from the lake, \r\nand sometimes neither goblin nor fish came back. \r\n\r\nActually Gollum lived on a slimy island of rock in the middle of the lake. He was watching Bilbo \r\nnow from the distance with his pale eyes like telescopes. Bilbo could not see him, but he was \r\nwondering a lot about Bilbo, for he could see that he was no goblin at all. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGollum got into his boat and shot off from the island, while Bilbo was sitting on the brink \r\naltogether flummoxed and at the end of his way and his wits. Suddenly up came Gollum and \r\nwhispered and hissed: \r\n\r\n“Bless us and splash us, my precioussss! I guess it’s a choice feast; at least a tasty morsel it’d \r\nmake us, gollum!” And when he said gollum he made a horrible swallowing noise in his throat. That is \r\nhow he got his name, though he always called himself ‘my precious’. \r\n\r\nThe hobbit jumped nearly out of his skin when the hiss came in his ears, and he suddenly saw the \r\npale eyes sticking out at him. \r\n\r\n“Who are you?” he said, thrusting his dagger in front of him. \r\n\r\n“What iss he, my preciouss?” whispered Gollum (who always spoke to himself through never \r\nhaving anyone else to speak to). This is what he had come to find out, for he was not really very \r\nhungry at the moment, only curious; otherwise he would have grabbed first and whispered afterwards. \r\n\r\n“I am Mr. Bilbo Baggins. I have lost the dwarves and I have lost the wizard, and I don’t know \r\nwhere I am; and I don’t want to know, if only I can get away.” \r\n\r\n“What’s he got in his handses?” said Gollum, looking at the sword, which he did not quite like. \r\n\r\n“A sword, a blade which came out of Gondolin!” “Sssss” said Gollum, and became quite polite. \r\n“Praps ye sits here and chats with it a bitsy, my preciousss. It likes riddles, praps it does, does it?” He \r\nwas anxious to appear friendly, at any rate for the moment, and until he found out more about the \r\nsword and the hobbit, whether he was quite alone really, whether he was good to eat, and whether \r\nGollum was really hungry. Riddles were all he could think of. Asking them, and sometimes guessing \r\nthem, had been the only game he had ever played with other funny creatures sitting in their holes in \r\nthe long, long ago, before he lost all his friends and was driven away, alone, and crept down, down, \r\ninto the dark under the mountains. \r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Bilbo, who was anxious to agree, until he found out more about the creature, \r\nwhether he was quite alone, whether he was fierce or hungry, and whether he was a friend of the \r\ngoblins. \r\n\r\n“You ask first,” he said, because he had not had time to think of a riddle. \r\n\r\nSo Gollum hissed: \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat has roots as nobody sees, \r\nIs taller than trees, \r\n\r\nUp, up it goes, \r\n\r\nAnd yet never grows ? \r\n\r\n\r\n“Easy!” said Bilbo. “Mountain, I suppose.” \r\n\r\n“Does it guess easy? It must have a competition with us, my preciouss! If precious asks, and it \r\ndoesn’t answer, we eats it, my preciousss. If it asks us, and we doesn’t answer, then we does what it \r\nwants, eh? We shows it the way out, yes!” \r\n\r\n“All right!” said Bilbo, not daring to disagree, and nearly bursting his brain to think of riddles that \r\ncould save him from being eaten. \r\n\r\n\r\nThirty white horses on a red hill, \r\nFirst they champ, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen they stamp, \r\nThen they stand still. \r\n\r\n\r\nThat was all he could think of to ask — the idea of eating was rather on his mind. It was rather an \r\nold one, too, and Gollum knew the answer as well as you do. \r\n\r\n“Chestnuts, chestnuts,” he hissed. “Teeth! teeth! my preciousss; but we has only six!” Then he \r\nasked his second: \r\n\r\n\r\nVoiceless it cries, \r\nWingless flutters, \r\nToothless bites, \r\nMouthless mutters. \r\n\r\n\r\n“Half a moment!” cried Bilbo, who was still thinking uncomfortably about eating. Fortunately he \r\nhad once heard something rather like this before, and getting his wits back he thought of the answer. \r\n“Wind, wind of course,” he said, and he was so pleased that he made up one on the spot. “This’ll \r\npuzzle the nasty little underground creature,” he thought: \r\n\r\n\r\nAn eye in a blue face \r\nSaw an eye in a green face. \r\n“That eye is like to this eye ” \r\nSaid the first eye, \r\n\r\n“But in low place \r\nNot in high place. ” \r\n\r\n\r\n“Ss, ss, ss,” said Gollum. He had been underground a long long time, and was forgetting this sort of \r\nthing. But just as Bilbo was beginning to hope that the wretch would not be able to answer, Gollum \r\nbrought up memories of ages and ages and ages before, when he lived with his grandmother in a hole \r\nin a bank by a river, “Sss, sss, my preciouss,” he said. “Sun on the daisies it means, it does.” \r\n\r\nBut these ordinary above ground everyday sort of riddles were tiring for him. Also they reminded \r\nhim of days when he had been less lonely and sneaky and nasty, and that put him out of temper. What \r\nis more they made him hungry; so this time he tried something a bit more difficult and more \r\nunpleasant: \r\n\r\n\r\nIt cannot be seen, cannot be felt, \r\nCannot be heard, cannot be smelt. \r\nIt lies behind stars and under hills, \r\nAnd empty holes it fills. \r\n\r\nIt comes first and follows after, \r\nEnds life, kills laughter. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Gollum Bilbo had heard that sort of thing before; and the answer was all round \r\nhim any way. “Dark!” he said without even scratching his head or putting on his thinking cap. \r\n\r\n\r\nA box without hinges, key, or lid, \r\nYet golden treasure inside is hid, \r\n\r\n\r\nhe asked to gain time, until he could think of a really hard one. This he thought a dreadfully easy \r\nchestnut, though he had not asked it in the usual words. But it proved a nasty poser for Gollum. He \r\nhissed to himself, and still he did not answer; he whispered and spluttered. \r\n\r\nAfter some while Bilbo became impatient. “Well, what is it?” he said. “The answer’s not a kettle \r\nboiling over, as you seem to think from the noise you are making.” \r\n\r\n“Give us a chance; let it give us a chance, my preciouss — ss — ss.” \r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bilbo after giving him a long chance, “what about your guess?” \r\n\r\nBut suddenly Gollum remembered thieving from nests long ago, and sitting under the river bank \r\nteaching his grandmother, teaching his grandmother to suck — “Eggses!” he hissed. “Eggses it is!” \r\nThen he asked: \r\n\r\n\r\nAlive without breath, \r\n\r\nAs cold as death; \r\n\r\nNever thirsty, ever drinking, \r\nAll in mail never clinking. \r\n\r\n\r\nHe also in his turn thought this was a dreadfully easy one, because he was always thinking of the \r\nanswer. But he could not remember anything better at the moment, he was so flustered by the egg- \r\nquestion. All the same it was a poser for poor Bilbo, who never had anything to do with the water if he \r\ncould help it. I imagine you know the answer, of course, or can guess it as easy as winking, since you \r\nare sitting comfortably at home and have not the danger of being eaten to disturb your thinking. Bilbo \r\nsat and cleared his throat once or twice, but no answer came. \r\n\r\nAfter a while Gollum began to hiss with pleasure to himself: “Is it nice, my preciousss? Is it juicy? \r\nIs it scrumptiously crunchable?” He began to peer at Bilbo out of the darkness. \r\n\r\n“Half a moment,” said the hobbit shivering. “I gave you a good long chance just now.” \r\n\r\n“It must make haste, haste!” said Gollum, beginning to climb out of his boat on to the shore to get \r\nat Bilbo. But when he put his long webby foot in the water, a fish jumped out in a fright and fell on \r\nBilbo’s toes. \r\n\r\n“Ugh!” he said, “it is cold and clammy!” — and so he guessed. “Fish! fish!” he cried. “It is fish!” \r\n\r\nGollum was dreadfully disappointed; but Bilbo asked another riddle as quick as ever he could, so \r\nthat Gollum had to get back into his boat and think. \r\n\r\nNo-legs lay on one-leg, two-legs sat near on three-legs, four-legs got some. \r\n\r\nIt was not really the right time for this riddle, but Bilbo was in a hurry. Gollum might have had \r\nsome trouble guessing it, if he had asked it at another time. As it was, talking of fish, “no-legs” was \r\nnot so very difficult, and after that the rest was easy. “Fish on a little table, man at table sitting on a \r\nstool, the cat has the bones” that of course is the answer, and Gollum soon gave it. Then he thought the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime had come to ask something hard and horrible. This is what he said: \r\n\r\n\r\nThis thing all things devours : \r\nBirds, beasts, trees, flowers; \r\nGnaws iron, bites steel; \r\n\r\nGrinds hard stones to meal; \r\nSlays king, ruins town, \r\n\r\nAnd beats high mountain down. \r\n\r\n\r\nPoor Bilbo sat in the dark thinking of all the horrible names of all the giants and ogres he had ever \r\nheard told of in tales, but not one of them had done all these things. He had a feeling that the answer \r\nwas quite different and that he ought to know it, but he could not think of it. He began to get \r\nfrightened, and that is bad for thinking. Gollum began to get out of his boat. He flapped into the water \r\nand paddled to the bank; Bilbo could see his eyes coming towards him. His tongue seemed to stick in \r\nhis mouth; he wanted to shout out: “Give me more time! Give me time!” But all that came out with a \r\nsudden squeal was: \r\n\r\n\r\n“Time! Time!” \r\n\r\nBilbo was saved by pure luck. For that of course was the answer. \r\n\r\nGollum was disappointed once more; and now he was getting angry, and also tired of the game. It \r\nhad made him very hungry indeed. This time he did not go back to the boat. He sat down in the dark \r\nby Bilbo. That made the hobbit most dreadfully uncomfortable and scattered his wits. \r\n\r\n“It’s got to ask uss a quesstion, my preciouss, yes, yess, yesss. Jusst one more question to guess, \r\nyes, yess,” said Gollum. \r\n\r\nBut Bilbo simply could not think of any question with that nasty wet cold thing sitting next to him, \r\nand pawing and poking him. He scratched himself, he pinched himself; still he could not think of \r\nanything. \r\n\r\n“Ask us! ask us!” said Gollum. \r\n\r\nBilbo pinched himself and slapped himself; he gripped on his little sword; he even felt in his \r\npocket with his other hand. There he found the ring he had picked up in the passage and forgotten \r\nabout. \r\n\r\n“What have I got in my pocket?” he said aloud. He was talking to himself, but Gollum thought it \r\nwas a riddle, and he was frightfully upset. \r\n\r\n“Not fair! not fair!” he hissed. “It isn’t fair, my precious, is it, to ask us what it’s got in its nassty \r\nlittle pocketses?” \r\n\r\nBilbo seeing what had happened and having nothing better to ask stuck to his question, “What have \r\nI got in my pocket?” he said louder. \r\n\r\n“S-s-s-s-s,” hissed Gollum. “It must give us three guesseses, my preciouss, three guesseses.” \r\n\r\n“Very well! Guess away!” said Bilbo. \r\n\r\n“Handses!” said Gollum. \r\n\r\n“Wrong,” said Bilbo, who had luckily just taken his hand out again. “Guess again!” \r\n\r\n“S-s-s-s-s,” said Gollum more upset than ever. He thought of all the things he kept in his own \r\npockets: fish-bones, goblins’ teeth, wet shells, a bit of bat-wing, a sharp stone to sharpen his fangs on, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand other nasty things. He tried to think what other people kept in their pockets. \r\n\r\n“Knife!” he said at last. \r\n\r\n“Wrong!” said Bilbo, who had lost his some time ago. “Last guess!” \r\n\r\nNow Gollum was in a much worse state than when Bilbo had asked him the egg-question. He \r\nhissed and spluttered and rocked himself backwards and forwards, and slapped his feet on the floor, \r\nand wriggled and squirmed; but still he did not dare to waste his last guess. \r\n\r\n“Come on!” said Bilbo. “I am waiting!” He tried to sound bold and cheerful, but he did not feel at \r\nall sure how the game was going to end, whether Gollum guessed right or not. \r\n\r\n“Time’s up!” he said. \r\n\r\n“String, or nothing!” shrieked Gollum, which was not quite fair — working in two guesses at once. \r\n\r\n“Both wrong,” cried Bilbo very much relieved; and he jumped at once to his feet, put his back to \r\nthe nearest wall, and held out his little sword. He knew, of course, that the riddle-game was sacred and \r\nof immense antiquity, and even wicked creatures were afraid to cheat when they played at it. But he \r\nfelt he could not trust this slimy thing to keep any promise at a pinch. Any excuse would do for him to \r\nslide out of it. And after all that last question had not been a genuine riddle according to the ancient \r\nlaws. \r\n\r\nBut at any rate Gollum did not at once attack him. He could see the sword in Bilbo’s hand. He sat \r\nstill, shivering and whispering. At last Bilbo could wait no longer. \r\n\r\n“Well?” he said. “What about your promise? I want to go. You must show me the way.” \r\n\r\n“Did we say so, precious? Show the nassty little Baggins the way out, yes, yes. But what has it got \r\nin its pocketses, eh? Not string, precious, but not nothing. Oh no! gollum!” \r\n\r\n“Never you mind,” said Bilbo. “A promise is a promise.” \r\n\r\n“Cross it is, impatient, precious,” hissed Gollum. “But it must wait, yes it must. We can’t go up the \r\ntunnels so hasty. We must go and get some things first, yes, things to help us.” \r\n\r\n“Well, hurry up!” said Bilbo, relieved to think of Gollum going away. He thought he was just \r\nmaking an excuse and did not mean to come back. What was Gollum talking about? What useful thing \r\ncould he keep out on the dark lake? But he was wrong. Gollum did mean to come back. He was angry \r\nnow and hungry. And he was a miserable wicked creature, and already he had a plan. \r\n\r\nNot far away was his island, of which Bilbo knew nothing, and there in his hiding-place he kept a \r\nfew wretched oddments, and one very beautiful thing, very beautiful, very wonderful. He had a ring, a \r\ngolden ring, a precious ring. \r\n\r\n“My birthday-present!” he whispered to himself, as he had often done in the endless dark days. \r\n“That’s what we wants now, yes; we wants it!” \r\n\r\nHe wanted it because it was a ring of power, and if you slipped that ring on your finger, you were \r\ninvisible; only in the full sunlight could you be seen, and then only by your shadow, and that would be \r\nshaky and faint. \r\n\r\n“My birthday-present! It came to me on my birthday, my precious.” So he had always said to \r\nhimself. But who knows how Gollum came by that present, ages ago in the old days when such rings \r\nwere still at large in the world? Perhaps even the Master who ruled them could not have said. Gollum \r\nused to wear it at first, till it tired him; and then he kept it in a pouch next his skin, till it galled him; \r\nand now usually he hid it in a hole in the rock on his island, and was always going back to look at it. \r\nAnd still sometimes he put it on, when he could not bear to be parted from it any longer, or when he \r\nwas very, very, hungry, and tired of fish. Then he would creep along dark passages looking for stray \r\ngoblins. He might even venture into places where the torches were lit and made his eyes blink and \r\nsmart; for he would be safe. Oh yes, quite safe. No one would see him, no one would notice him, till \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe had his fingers on their throat. Only a few hours ago he had worn it, and caught a small goblin-imp. \r\nHow it squeaked! He still had a bone or two left to gnaw, but he wanted something softer. \r\n\r\n“Quite safe, yes,” he whispered to himself. “It won’t see us, will it, my precious? No. It won’t see \r\nus, and its nassty little sword will be useless, yes quite.” \r\n\r\nThat is what was in his wicked little mind, as he slipped suddenly from Bilbo’s side, and flapped \r\nback to his boat, and went off into the dark. Bilbo thought he had heard the last of him. Still he waited \r\na while; for he had no idea how to find his way out alone. \r\n\r\nSuddenly he heard a screech. It sent a shiver down his back. Gollum was cursing and wailing away \r\nin the gloom, not very far off by the sound of it. He was on his island, scrabbling here and there, \r\nsearching and seeking in vain. \r\n\r\n“Where iss it? Where iss it?” Bilbo heard him crying. “Losst it is, my precious, lost, lost! Curse us \r\nand crush us, my precious is lost!” \r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” Bilbo called. “What have you lost?” \r\n\r\n“It mustn’t ask us,” shrieked Gollum. “Not its business, no, gollum! It’s losst, gollum, gollum, \r\ngollum.” \r\n\r\n“Well, so am I,” cried Bilbo, “and I want to get unlost. And I won the game, and you promised. So \r\ncome along! Come and let me out, and then go on with your looking!” Utterly miserable as Gollum \r\nsounded, Bilbo could not find much pity in his heart, and he had a feeling that anything Gollum \r\nwanted so much could hardly be something good. “Come along!” he shouted. \r\n\r\n“No, not yet, precious!” Gollum answered. “We must search for it, it’s lost, gollum.” \r\n\r\n“But you never guessed my last question, and you promised,” said Bilbo. \r\n\r\n“Never guessed!” said Gollum. Then suddenly out of the gloom came a sharp hiss. “What has it got \r\nin its pocketses? Tell us that. It must tell first.” \r\n\r\nAs far as Bilbo knew, there was no particular reason why he should not tell. Gollum’ s mind had \r\njumped to a guess quicker than his; naturally, for Gollum had brooded for ages on this one thing, and \r\nhe was always afraid of its being stolen. But Bilbo was annoyed at the delay. After all, he had won the \r\ngame, pretty fairly, at a horrible risk. “Answers were to be guessed not given,” he said. \r\n\r\n“But it wasn’t a fair question,” said Gollum. “Not a riddle, precious, no.” \r\n\r\n“Oh well, if it’s a matter of ordinary questions,” Bilbo replied, “then I asked one first. What have \r\nyou lost? Tell me that!” \r\n\r\n“What has it got in its pocketses?” The sound came hissing louder and sharper, and as he looked \r\ntowards it, to his alarm Bilbo now saw two small points of light peering at him. As suspicion grew in \r\nGollum’ s mind, the light of his eyes burned with a pale flame. \r\n\r\n“What have you lost?” Bilbo persisted. \r\n\r\nBut now the light in Gollum’ s eyes had become a green fire, and it was coming swiftly nearer. \r\nGollum was in his boat again, paddling wildly back to the dark shore; and such a rage of loss and \r\nsuspicion was in his heart that no sword had any more terror for him. \r\n\r\nBilbo could not guess what had maddened the wretched creature, but he saw that all was up, and \r\nthat Gollum meant to murder him at any rate. Just in time he turned and ran blindly back up the dark \r\npassage down which he had come, keeping close to the wall and feeling it with his left hand. \r\n\r\n“What has it got in its pocketses?” he heard the hiss loud behind him, and the splash as Gollum \r\nleapt from his boat. “What have I, I wonder?” he said to himself, as he panted and stumbled along. He \r\nput his left hand in his pocket. The ring felt very cold as it quietly slipped on to his groping forefinger. \r\n\r\nThe hiss was close behind him. He turned now and saw Gollum’ s eyes like small green lamps \r\ncoming up the slope. Terrified he tried to run faster, but suddenly he struck his toes on a snag in the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfloor, and fell flat with his little sword under him. \r\n\r\nIn a moment Gollum was on him. But before Bilbo could do anything, recover his breath, pick \r\nhimself up, or wave his sword, Gollum passed by, taking no notice of him, cursing and whispering as \r\nhe ran. \r\n\r\nWhat could it mean? Gollum could see in the dark. Bilbo could see the light of his eyes palely \r\nshining even from behind. Painfully he got up, and sheathed his sword, which was now glowing faintly \r\nagain, then very cautiously he followed. There seemed nothing else to do. It was no good crawling \r\nback down to Gollum’ s water. Perhaps if he followed him, Gollum might lead him to some way of \r\nescape without meaning to. \r\n\r\n“Curse it! curse it! curse it!” hissed Gollum. “Curse the Baggins! It’s gone! What has it got in its \r\npocketses? Oh we guess, we guess, my precious. He’s found it, yes he must have. My birthday- \r\npresent.” \r\n\r\nBilbo pricked up his ears. He was at last beginning to guess himself. He hurried a little, getting as \r\nclose as he dared behind Gollum, who was still going quickly, not looking back, but turning his head \r\nfrom side to side, as Bilbo could see from the faint glimmer on the walls. \r\n\r\n“My birthday-present! Curse it! How did we lose it, my precious? Yes, that’s it. When we came \r\nthis way last, when we twisted that nassty young squeaker. That’s it. Curse it! It slipped from us, after \r\nall these ages and ages! It’s gone, gollum.” \r\n\r\nSuddenly Gollum sat down and began to weep, a whistling and gurgling sound horrible to listen to. \r\nBilbo halted and flattened himself against the tunnel-wall. After a while Gollum stopped weeping and \r\nbegan to talk. He seemed to be having an argument with himself. \r\n\r\n“It’s no good going back there to search, no. We doesn’t remember all the places we’ve visited. \r\nAnd it’s no use. The Baggins has got it in its pocketses; the nassty noser has found it, we says.” \r\n\r\n“We guesses, precious, only guesses. We can’t know till we find the nassty creature and squeezes \r\nit. But it doesn’t know what the present can do, does it? It’ll just keep it in its pocketses. It doesn’t \r\nknow, and it can’t go far. It’s lost itself, the nassty nosey thing. It doesn’t know the way out. It said \r\nso.” \r\n\r\n“It said so, yes; but it’s tricksy. It doesn’t say what it means. It won’t say what it’s got in its \r\npocketses. It knows. It knows a way in, it must know a way out, yes. It’s off to the back-door. To the \r\nback-door, that’s it.” \r\n\r\n“The goblinses will catch it then. It can’t get out that way, precious.” \r\n\r\n“Ssss, sss, gollum! Goblinses! Yes, but if it’s got the present, our precious present, then goblinses \r\nwill get it, gollum! They’ll find it, they’ll find out what it does. We shan’t ever be safe again, never, \r\ngollum! One of the goblinses will put it on, and then no one will see him. He’ll be there but not seen. \r\nNot even our clever eyeses will notice him; and he’ll come creepsy and tricksy and catch us, gollum, \r\ngollum!” \r\n\r\n“Then let’s stop talking, precious, and make haste. If the Baggins has gone that way, we must go \r\nquick and see. Go! Not far now. Make haste!” \r\n\r\nWith a spring Gollum got up and started shambling off at a great pace. Bilbo hurried after him, still \r\ncautiously, though his chief fear now was of tripping on another snag and falling with a noise. His \r\nhead was in a whirl of hope and wonder. It seemed that the ring he had was a magic ring: it made you \r\ninvisible! He had heard of such things, of course, in old old tales; but it was hard to believe that he \r\nreally had found one, by accident. Still there it was: Gollum with his bright eyes had passed him by, \r\nonly a yard to one side. \r\n\r\nOn they went, Gollum flip-flapping ahead, hissing and cursing; Bilbo behind going as softly as a \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhobbit can. Soon they came to places where, as Bilbo had noticed on the way down, side-passages \r\nopened, this way and that. Gollum began at once to count them. \r\n\r\n“One left, yes. One right, yes. Two right, yes, yes. Two left, yes, yes.” And so on and on. \r\n\r\nAs the count grew he slowed down, and he began to get shaky and weepy; for he was leaving the \r\nwater further and further behind, and he was getting afraid. Goblins might be about, and he had lost \r\nhis ring. At last he stopped by a low opening, on their left as they went up. \r\n\r\n“Seven right, yes. Six left, yes!” he whispered. “This is it. This is the way to the back-door, yes. \r\nHere’s the passage!” \r\n\r\nHe peered in, and shrank back. “But we dursn’t go in, precious, no we dursn’t. Goblinses down \r\nthere. Lots of goblinses. We smells them. Ssss!” \r\n\r\n“What shall we do? Curse them and crush them! We must wait here, precious, wait a bit and see.” \r\n\r\nSo they came to a dead stop. Gollum had brought Bilbo to the way out after all, but Bilbo could not \r\nget in! There was Gollum sitting humped up right in the opening, and his eyes gleamed cold in his \r\nhead, as he swayed it from side to side between his knees. \r\n\r\nBilbo crept away from the wall more quietly than a mouse; but Gollum stiffened at once, and \r\nsniffed, and his eyes went green. He hissed softly but menacingly. He could not see the hobbit, but \r\nnow he was on the alert, and he had other senses that the darkness had sharpened: hearing and smell. \r\nHe seemed to be crouched right down with his flat hands splayed on the floor, and his head thrust out, \r\nnose almost to the stone. Though he was only a black shadow in the gleam of his own eyes, Bilbo \r\ncould see or feel that he was tense as a bowstring, gathered for a spring. \r\n\r\nBilbo almost stopped breathing, and went stiff himself. He was desperate. He must get away, out of \r\nthis horrible darkness, while he had any strength left. He must fight. He must stab the foul thing, put \r\nits eyes out, kill it. It meant to kill him. No, not a fair fight. He was invisible now. Gollum had no \r\nsword. Gollum had not actually threatened to kill him, or tried to yet. And he was miserable, alone, \r\nlost. A sudden understanding, a pity mixed with horror, welled up in Bilbo’s heart: a glimpse of \r\nendless unmarked days without light or hope of betterment, hard stone, cold fish, sneaking and \r\nwhispering. All these thoughts passed in a flash of a second. He trembled. And then quite suddenly in \r\nanother flash, as if lifted by a new strength and resolve, he leaped. \r\n\r\nNo great leap for a man, but a leap in the dark. Straight over Gollum’ s head he jumped, seven feet \r\nforward and three in the air; indeed, had he known it, he only just missed cracking his skull on the low \r\narch of the passage. \r\n\r\nGollum threw himself backwards, and grabbed as the hobbit flew over him, but too late: his hands \r\nsnapped on thin air, and Bilbo, falling fair on his sturdy feet, sped off down the new tunnel. He did not \r\nturn to see what Gollum was doing. There was a hissing and cursing almost at his heels at first, then it \r\nstopped. All at once there came a blood-curdling shriek, filled with hatred and despair. Gollum was \r\ndefeated. He dared go no further. He had lost: lost his prey, and lost, too, the only thing he had ever \r\ncared for, his precious. The cry brought Bilbo’s heart to his mouth, but still he held on. Now faint as \r\nan echo, but menacing, the voice came behind: \r\n\r\n“Thief, thief, thief! Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it for ever!” \r\n\r\nThen there was a silence. But that too seemed menacing to Bilbo. “If goblins are so near that he \r\nsmelt them,” he thought, “then they’ll have heard his shrieking and cursing. Careful now, or this way \r\nwill lead you to worse things.” \r\n\r\nThe passage was low and roughly made. It was not too difficult for the hobbit, except when, in \r\nspite of all care, he stubbed his poor toes again, several times, on nasty jagged stones in the floor. “A \r\nbit low for goblins, at least for the big ones,” thought Bilbo, not knowing that even the big ones, the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nores of the mountains, go along at a great speed stooping low with their hands almost on the ground. \r\n\r\nSoon the passage that had been sloping down began to go up again, and after a while it climbed \r\nsteeply. That slowed Bilbo down. But at last the slope stopped, the passage turned a corner and dipped \r\ndown again, and there, at the bottom of a short incline, he saw, filtering round another corner — a \r\nglimpse of light. Not red light, as of fire or lantern, but a pale out-of-doors sort of light. Then Bilbo \r\nbegan to run. \r\n\r\nScuttling as fast as his legs would carry him he turned the last corner and came suddenly right into \r\nan open space, where the light, after all that time in the dark, seemed dazzlingly bright. Really it was \r\nonly a leak of sunshine in through a doorway, where a great door, a stone door, was left standing open. \r\n\r\nBilbo blinked, and then suddenly he saw the goblins: goblins in full armour with drawn swords \r\nsitting just inside the door, and watching it with wide eyes, and watching the passage that led to it. \r\nThey were aroused, alert, ready for anything. \r\n\r\nThey saw him sooner than he saw them. Yes, they saw him. Whether it was an accident, or a last \r\ntrick of the ring before it took a new master, it was not on his finger. With yells of delight the goblins \r\nrushed upon him. \r\n\r\nA pang of fear and loss, like an echo of GollunTs misery, smote Bilbo, and forgetting even to draw \r\nhis sword he struck his hands into his pockets. And there was the ring still, in his left pocket, and it \r\nslipped on his finger. The goblins stopped short. They could not see a sign of him. He had vanished. \r\nThey yelled twice as loud as before, but not so delightedly. \r\n\r\n“Where is it?” they cried. \r\n\r\n“Go back up the passage!” some shouted. \r\n\r\n“This way!” some yelled. “That way!” others yelled. “Look out for the door,” bellowed the captain. \r\nWhistles blew, armour clashed, swords rattled, goblins cursed and swore and ran hither and thither, \r\nfalling over one another and getting very angry. There was a terrible outcry, to-do, and disturbance. \r\n\r\nBilbo was dreadfully frightened, but he had the sense to understand what had happened and to \r\nsneak behind a big barrel which held drink for the goblin-guards, and so get out of the way and avoid \r\nbeing bumped into, trampled to death, or caught by feel. \r\n\r\n“I must get to the door, I must get to the door!” he kept on saying to himself, but it was a long time \r\nbefore he ventured to try. Then it was like a horrible game of blind-man’s-buff. The place was full of \r\ngoblins running about, and the poor little hobbit dodged this way and that, was knocked over by a \r\ngoblin who could not make out what he had bumped into, scrambled away on all fours, slipped \r\nbetween the legs of the captain just in time, got up, and ran for the door. \r\n\r\nIt was still ajar, but a goblin had pushed it nearly to. Bilbo struggled but he could not move it. He \r\ntried to squeeze through the crack. He squeezed and squeezed, and he stuck! It was awful. His buttons \r\nhad got wedged on the edge of the door and the door-post. He could see outside into the open air: there \r\nwere a few steps running down into a narrow valley between tall mountains; the sun came out from \r\nbehind a cloud and shone bright on the outside of the door — but he could not get through. \r\n\r\nSuddenly one of the goblins inside shouted: “There is a shadow by the door. Something is outside!” \r\n\r\nBilbo’s heart jumped into his mouth. He gave a terrific squirm. Buttons burst off in all directions. \r\nHe was through, with a torn coat and waistcoat, leaping down the steps like a goat, while bewildered \r\ngoblins were still picking up his nice brass buttons on the doorstep. \r\n\r\nOf course they soon came down after him, hooting and hallooing, and hunting among the trees. But \r\nthey don’t like the sun: it makes their legs wobble and their heads giddy. They could not find Bilbo \r\nwith the ring on, slipping in and out of the shadow of the trees, running quick and quiet, and keeping \r\nout of the sun; so soon they went back grumbling and cursing to guard the door. Bilbo had escaped."

    "ChapterData": "Bilbo had escaped the goblins, but he did not know where he was. He had lost hood, cloak, food, pony, \r\nhis buttons and his friends. He wandered on and on, till the sun began to sink westwards — behind the \r\nmountains. Their shadows fell across Bilbo’s path, and he looked back. Then he looked forward and \r\ncould see before him only ridges and slopes falling towards lowlands and plains glimpsed \r\noccasionally between the trees. \r\n\r\n“Good heavens!” he exclaimed. “I seem to have got right to the other side of the Misty Mountains, \r\nright to the edge of the Land Beyond! Where and O where can Gandalf and the dwarves have got to? I \r\nonly hope to goodness they are not still back there in the power of the goblins!” \r\n\r\nHe still wandered on, out of the little high valley, over its edge, and down the slopes beyond; but \r\nall the while a very uncomfortable thought was growing inside him. He wondered whether he ought \r\nnot, now he had the magic ring, to go back into the horrible, horrible, tunnels and look for his friends. \r\nHe had just made up his mind that it was his duty, that he must turn back — and very miserable he felt \r\nabout it — when he heard voices. \r\n\r\nHe stopped and listened. It did not sound like goblins; so he crept forward carefully. He was on a \r\nstony path winding downwards with a rocky wall on the left hand; on the other side the ground sloped \r\naway and there were dells below the level of the path overhung with bushes and low trees. In one of \r\nthese dells under the bushes people were talking. \r\n\r\nHe crept still nearer, and suddenly he saw peering between two big boulders a head with a red hood \r\non: it was Balin doing look-out. He could have clapped and shouted for joy, but he did not. He had still \r\ngot the ring on, for fear of meeting something unexpected and unpleasant, and he saw that Balin was \r\nlooking straight at him without noticing him. \r\n\r\n“I will give them all a surprise,” he thought, as he crawled into the bushes at the edge of the dell. \r\nGandalf was arguing with the dwarves. They were discussing all that had happened to them in the \r\ntunnels, and wondering and debating what they were to do now. The dwarves were grumbling, and \r\nGandalf was saying that they could not possibly go on with their journey leaving Mr. Baggins in the \r\nhands of the goblins, without trying to find out if he was alive or dead, and without trying to rescue \r\nhim. \r\n\r\n“After all he is my friend,” said the wizard, “and not a bad little chap. I feel responsible for him. I \r\nwish to goodness you had not lost him.” \r\n\r\nThe dwarves wanted to know why he had ever been brought at all, why he could not stick to his \r\nfriends and come along with them, and why the wizard had not chosen someone with more sense. “He \r\nhas been more trouble than use so far,” said one. “If we have got to go back now into those \r\nabominable tunnels to look for him, then drat him, I say.” \r\n\r\nGandalf answered angrily: “I brought him, and I don’t bring things that are of no use. Either you \r\nhelp me to look for him, or I go and leave you here to get out of the mess as best you can yourselves. \r\n\r\nIf we can only find him again, you will thank me before all is over. Whatever did you want to go and \r\ndrop him for, Dori?” \r\n\r\n\r\n“You would have dropped him,” said Dori, “if a goblin had suddenly grabbed your legs from \r\nbehind in the dark, tripped up your feet, and kicked you in the back!” \r\n\r\n“Then why didn’t you pick him up again?” \r\n\r\n“Good heavens! Can you ask! Goblins fighting and biting in the dark, everybody falling over \r\nbodies and hitting one another! You nearly chopped off my head with Glamdring, and Thorin was \r\nstabbing here there and everywhere with Orcrist. All of a sudden you gave one of your blinding \r\nflashes, and we saw the goblins running back yelping. You shouted ‘follow me everybody!’ and \r\neverybody ought to have followed. We thought everybody had. There was no time to count, as you \r\nknow quite well, till we had dashed through the gate-guards, out of the lower door, and helter-skelter \r\ndown here. And here we are — without the burglar, confusticate him!” \r\n\r\n“And here’s the burglar!” said Bilbo stepping down into the middle of them, and slipping off the \r\nring. \r\n\r\nBless me, how they jumped! Then they shouted with surprise and delight. Gandalf was as \r\nastonished as any of them, but probably more pleased than all the others. He called to Balin and told \r\nhim what he thought of a look-out man who let people walk right into them like that without warning. \r\nIt is a fact that Bilbo’s reputation went up a very great deal with the dwarves after this. If they had still \r\ndoubted that he was really a first-class burglar, in spite of Gandalf’ s words, they doubted no longer. \r\nBalin was the most puzzled of all; but everyone said it was a very clever bit of work. \r\n\r\nIndeed Bilbo was so pleased with their praise that he just chuckled inside and said nothing \r\nwhatever about the ring; and when they asked him how he did it, he said: “Oh, just crept along, you \r\nknow — very carefully and quietly.” \r\n\r\n“Well, it is the first time that even a mouse has crept along carefully and quietly under my very \r\nnose and not been spotted,” said Balin, “and I take off my hood to you.” Which he did. \r\n\r\n“Balin at your service,” said he. \r\n\r\n“Your servant, Mr. Baggins,” said Bilbo. \r\n\r\nThen they wanted to know all about his adventures after they had lost him, and he sat down and \r\ntold them everything — except about the finding of the ring (“not just now” he thought). They were \r\nparticularly interested in the riddle-competition, and shuddered most appreciatively at his description \r\nof Gollum. \r\n\r\n“And then I couldn’t think of any other question with him sitting beside me,” ended Bilbo; “so I \r\nsaid ‘what’s in my pocket?’ And he couldn’t guess in three goes. So I said: ‘what about your promise? \r\nShow me the way out! ’ But he came at me to kill me, and I ran, and fell over, and he missed me in the \r\ndark. Then I followed him, because I heard him talking to himself. He thought I really knew the way \r\nout, and so he was making for it. And then he sat down in the entrance, and I could not get by. So I \r\njumped over him and escaped, and ran down to the gate.” \r\n\r\n“What about the guards?” they asked. “Weren’t there any?” \r\n\r\n“O yes! lots of them; but I dodged ’em. I got stuck in the door, which was only open a crack, and I \r\nlost lots of buttons,” he said sadly looking at his torn clothes. “But I squeezed through all right — and \r\nhere I am.” \r\n\r\nThe dwarves looked at him with quite a new respect, when he talked about dodging guards, \r\njumping over Gollum, and squeezing through, as if it was not very difficult or very alarming. \r\n\r\n“What did I tell you?” said Gandalf laughing. “Mr. Baggins has more about him than you guess.” \r\nHe gave Bilbo a queer look from under his bushy eyebrows, as he said this, and the hobbit wondered if \r\nhe guessed at the part of his tale that he had left out. \r\n\r\nThen he had questions of his own to ask, for if Gandalf had explained it all by now to the dwarves, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBilbo had not heard it. He wanted to know how the wizard had turned up again, and where they had all \r\ngot to now. \r\n\r\nThe wizard, to tell the truth, never minded explaining his cleverness more than once, so now he \r\ntold Bilbo that both he and Elrond had been well aware of the presence of evil goblins in that part of \r\nthe mountains. But their main gate used to come out on a different pass, one more easy to travel by, so \r\nthat they often caught people benighted near their gates. Evidently people had given up going that \r\nway, and the goblins must have opened their new entrance at the top of the pass the dwarves had taken, \r\nquite recently, because it had been found quite safe up to now. \r\n\r\n“I must see if I can’t find a more or less decent giant to block it up again,” said Gandalf, “or soon \r\nthere will be no getting over the mountains at all.” \r\n\r\nAs soon as Gandalf had heard Bilbo’s yell he realized what had happened. In the flash which killed \r\nthe goblins that were grabbing him he had nipped inside the crack, just as it snapped to. He followed \r\nafter the drivers and prisoners right to the edge of the great hall, and there he sat down and worked up \r\nthe best magic he could in the shadows. \r\n\r\n“A very ticklish business, it was,” he said. “Touch and go!” \r\n\r\nBut, of course, Gandalf had made a special study of bewitchments with fire and lights (even the \r\nhobbit had never forgotten the magic fireworks at Old Took’s midsummer-eve parties, as you \r\nremember). The rest we all know — except that Gandalf knew all about the back-door, as the goblins \r\ncalled the lower gate, where Bilbo lost his buttons. As a matter of fact it was well known to anybody \r\nwho was acquainted with this part of the mountains; but it took a wizard to keep his head in the \r\ntunnels and guide them in the right direction. \r\n\r\n“They made that gate ages ago,” he said, “partly for a way of escape, if they needed one; partly as a \r\nway out into the lands beyond, where they still come in the dark and do great damage. They guard it \r\nalways and no one has ever managed to block it up. They will guard it doubly after this,” he laughed. \r\n\r\nAll the others laughed too. After all they had lost a good deal, but they had killed the Great Goblin \r\nand a great many others besides, and they had all escaped, so they might be said to have had the best \r\nof it so far. \r\n\r\nBut the wizard called them to their senses. “We must be getting on at once, now we are a little \r\nrested,” he said. “They will be out after us in hundreds when night comes on; and already shadows are \r\nlengthening. They can smell our footsteps for hours and hours after we have passed. We must be miles \r\non before dusk. There will be a bit of moon, if it keeps fine, and that is lucky. Not that they mind the \r\nmoon much, but it will give us a little light to steer by.” \r\n\r\n“O yes!” he said in answer to more questions from the hobbit. “You lose track of time inside \r\ngoblin-tunnels. Today’s Thursday, and it was Monday night or Tuesday morning that we were \r\ncaptured. We have gone miles and miles, and come right down through the heart of the mountains, and \r\nare now on the other side — quite a short cut. But we are not at the point to which our pass would have \r\nbrought us; we are too far to the North, and have some awkward country ahead. And we are still pretty \r\nhigh up. Let’s get on!” \r\n\r\n“I am dreadfully hungry,” groaned Bilbo, who was suddenly aware that he had not had a meal since \r\nthe night before the night before last. Just think of that for a hobbit! His stomach felt all empty and \r\nloose and his legs all wobbly, now that the excitement was over. \r\n\r\n“Can’t help it,” said Gandalf, “unless you like to go back and ask the goblins nicely to let you have \r\nyour pony back and your luggage.” \r\n\r\n“No thank you!” said Bilbo. \r\n\r\n“Very well then, we must just tighten our belts and trudge on — or we shall be made into supper, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand that will be much worse than having none ourselves.” \r\n\r\nAs they went on Bilbo looked from side to side for something to eat; but the blackberries were still \r\nonly in flower, and of course there were no nuts, not even hawthorn-berries. He nibbled a bit of sorrel, \r\nand he drank from a small mountain-stream that crossed the path, and he ate three wild strawberries \r\nthat he found on its bank, but it was not much good. \r\n\r\nThey still went on and on. The rough path disappeared. The bushes, and the long grasses between \r\nthe boulders, the patches of rabbit-cropped turf, the thyme and the sage and the marjoram, and the \r\nyellow rockroses all vanished, and they found themselves at the top of a wide steep slope of fallen \r\nstones, the remains of a landslide. When they began to go down this, rubbish and small pebbles rolled \r\naway from their feet; soon larger bits of split stone went clattering down and started other pieces \r\nbelow them slithering and rolling; then lumps of rock were disturbed and bounded off, crashing down \r\nwith a dust and a noise. Before long the whole slope above them and below them seemed on the move, \r\nand they were sliding away, huddled all together, in a fearful confusion of slipping, rattling, cracking \r\nslabs and stones. \r\n\r\nIt was the trees at the bottom that saved them. They slid into the edge of a climbing wood of pines \r\nthat here stood right up the mountain slope from the deeper darker forests of the valleys below. Some \r\ncaught hold of the trunks and swung themselves into lower branches, some (like the little hobbit) got \r\nbehind a tree to shelter from the onslaught of the rocks. Soon the danger was over, the slide had \r\nstopped, and the last faint crashes could be heard as the largest of the disturbed stones went bounding \r\nand spinning among the bracken and the pine-roots far below. \r\n\r\n“Well! that has got us on a bit,” said Gandalf; “and even goblins tracking us will have a job to \r\ncome down here quietly.” \r\n\r\n“I daresay,” grumbled Bombur; “but they won’t find it difficult to send stones bouncing down on \r\nour heads.” The dwarves (and Bilbo) were feeling far from happy, and were rubbing their bruised and \r\ndamaged legs and feet. \r\n\r\n“Nonsense! We are going to turn aside here out of the path of the slide. We must be quick! Look at \r\nthe light!” \r\n\r\nThe sun had long gone behind the mountains. Already the shadows were deepening about them, \r\nthough far away through the trees and over the black tops of those growing lower down they could still \r\nsee the evening lights on the plains beyond. They limped along now as fast as they were able down the \r\ngentle slopes of a pine forest in a slanting path leading steadily southwards. At times they were \r\npushing through a sea of bracken with tall fronds rising right above the hobbit’s head; at times they \r\nwere marching along quiet as quiet over a floor of pine-needles; and all the while the forest-gloom got \r\nheavier and the forest-silence deeper. There was no wind that evening to bring even a sea-sighing into \r\nthe branches of the trees. \r\n\r\n\r\n“Must we go any further?” asked Bilbo, when it was so dark that he could only just see Thorin’s beard \r\nwagging beside him, and so quiet that he could hear the dwarves’ breathing like a loud noise. “My toes \r\nare all bruised and bent, and my legs ache, and my stomach is wagging like an empty sack.” \r\n\r\n“A bit further,” said Gandalf. \r\n\r\nAfter what seemed ages further they came suddenly to an opening where no trees grew. The moon \r\nwas up and was shining into the clearing. Somehow it struck all of them as not at all a nice place, \r\nalthough there was nothing wrong to see. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden they heard a howl away down hill, a long shuddering howl. It was answered by \r\nanother away to the right and a good deal nearer to them; then by another not far away to the left. It \r\nwas wolves howling at the moon, wolves gathering together! \r\n\r\nThere were no wolves living near Mr. Baggins’ hole at home, but he knew that noise. He had had it \r\ndescribed to him often enough in tales. One of his elder cousins (on the Took side), who had been a \r\ngreat traveller, used to imitate it to frighten him. To hear it out in the forest under the moon was too \r\nmuch for Bilbo. Even magic rings are not much use against wolves — especially against the evil packs \r\nthat lived under the shadow of the goblin-infested mountains, over the Edge of the Wild on the borders \r\nof the unknown. Wolves of that sort smell keener than goblins, and do not need to see you to catch \r\nyou! \r\n\r\n“What shall we do, what shall we do!” he cried. “Escaping goblins to be caught by wolves!” he \r\nsaid, and it became a proverb, though we now say “out of the frying-pan into the fire” in the same sort \r\nof uncomfortable situations. \r\n\r\n“Up the trees quick!” cried Gandalf; and they ran to the trees at the edge of the glade, hunting for \r\nthose that had branches fairly low, or were slender enough to swarm up. They found them as quick as \r\never they could, you can guess; and up they went as high as ever they could trust the branches. You \r\nwould have laughed (from a safe distance), if you had seen the dwarves sitting up in the trees with \r\ntheir beards dangling down, like old gentlemen gone cracked and playing at being boys. Fili and Kili \r\nwere at the top of a tall larch like an enormous Christmas tree. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin were \r\nmore comfortable in a huge pine with regular branches sticking out at intervals like the spokes of a \r\nwheel. Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and Thorin were in another. Dwalin and Balin had swarmed up a tall \r\nslender fir with few branches and were trying to find a place to sit in the greenery of the topmost \r\nboughs. Gandalf, who was a good deal taller than the others, had found a tree into which they could \r\nnot climb, a large pine standing at the very edge of the glade. He was quite hidden in its boughs, but \r\nyou could see his eyes gleaming in the moon as he peeped out. \r\n\r\nAnd Bilbo? He could not get into any tree, and was scuttling about from trunk to trunk, like a rabbit \r\nthat has lost its hole and has a dog after it. \r\n\r\n“You’ve left the burglar behind again!” said Nori to Dori looking down. \r\n\r\n“I can’t be always carrying burglars on my back,” said Dori, “down tunnels and up trees! What do \r\nyou think I am? A porter?” \r\n\r\n“He’ll be eaten if we don’t do something,” said Thorin, for there were howls all round them now, \r\ngetting nearer and nearer. “Dori!” he called, for Dori was lowest down in the easiest tree, “be quick, \r\nand give Mr. Baggins a hand up!” \r\n\r\nDori was really a decent fellow in spite of his grumbling. Poor Bilbo could not reach his hand even \r\nwhen he climbed down to the bottom branch and hung his arm down as far as ever he could. So Dori \r\nactually climbed out of the tree and let Bilbo scramble up and stand on his back. \r\n\r\nJust at that moment the wolves trotted howling into the clearing. All of a sudden there were \r\nhundreds of eyes looking at them. Still Dori did not let Bilbo down. He waited till he had clambered \r\noff his shoulders into the branches, and then he jumped for the branches himself. Only just in time! A \r\nwolf snapped at his cloak as he swung up, and nearly got him. In a minute there was a whole pack of \r\nthem yelping all round the tree and leaping up at the trunk, with eyes blazing and tongues hanging out. \r\n\r\nBut even the wild Wargs (for so the evil wolves over the Edge of the Wild were named) cannot \r\nclimb trees. For a time they were safe. Luckily it was warm and not windy. Trees are not very \r\ncomfortable to sit in for long at any time; but in the cold and the wind, with wolves all round below \r\nwaiting for you, they can be perfectly miserable places. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis glade in the ring of trees was evidently a meeting-place of the wolves. More and more kept \r\ncoming in. They left guards at the foot of the tree in which Dori and Bilbo were, and then went \r\nsnuffling about till they had smelt out every tree that had anyone in it. These they guarded too, while \r\nall the rest (hundreds and hundreds it seemed) went and sat in a great circle in the glade; and in the \r\nmiddle of the circle was a great grey wolf. He spoke to them in the dreadful language of the Wargs. \r\nGandalf understood it. Bilbo did not, but it sounded terrible to him, and as if all their talk was about \r\ncruel and wicked things, as it was. Every now and then all the Wargs in the circle would answer their \r\ngrey chief all together, and their dreadful clamour almost made the hobbit fall out of his pine-tree. \r\n\r\nI will tell you what Gandalf heard, though Bilbo did not understand it. The Wargs and the goblins \r\noften helped one another in wicked deeds. Goblins do not usually venture very far from their \r\nmountains, unless they are driven out and are looking for new homes, or are marching to war (which I \r\nam glad to say has not happened for a long while). But in those days they sometimes used to go on \r\nraids, especially to get food or slaves to work for them. Then they often got the Wargs to help and \r\nshared the plunder with them. Sometimes they rode on wolves like men do on horses. Now it seemed \r\nthat a great goblin-raid had been planned for that very night. The Wargs had come to meet the goblins \r\nand the goblins were late. The reason, no doubt, was the death of the Great Goblin, and all the \r\nexcitement caused by the dwarves and Bilbo and the wizard, for whom they were probably still \r\nhunting. \r\n\r\nIn spite of the dangers of this far land bold men had of late been making their way back into it from \r\nthe South, cutting down trees, and building themselves places to live in among the more pleasant \r\nwoods in the valleys and along the river-shores. There were many of them, and they were brave and \r\nwell-armed, and even the Wargs dared not attack them if there were many together, or in the bright \r\nday. But now they had planned with the goblins’ help to come by night upon some of the villages \r\nnearest the mountains. If their plan had been carried out, there would have been none left there next \r\nday; all would have been killed except the few the goblins kept from the wolves and carried back as \r\nprisoners to their caves. \r\n\r\nThis was dreadful talk to listen to, not only because of the brave woodmen and their wives and \r\nchildren, but also because of the danger which now threatened Gandalf and his friends. The Wargs \r\nwere angry and puzzled at finding them here in their very meeting-place. They thought they were \r\nfriends of the woodmen, and were come to spy on them, and would take news of their plans down into \r\nthe valleys, and then the goblins and the wolves would have to fight a terrible battle instead of \r\ncapturing prisoners and devouring people waked suddenly from their sleep. So the Wargs had no \r\nintention of going away and letting the people up the trees escape, at any rate not until morning. And \r\nlong before that, they said, goblin soldiers would be coming down from the mountains; and goblins \r\ncan climb trees, or cut them down. \r\n\r\nNow you can understand why Gandalf, listening to their growling and yelping, began to be \r\ndreadfully afraid, wizard though he was, and to feel that they were in a very bad place, and had not yet \r\nescaped at all. All the same he was not going to let them have it all their own way, though he could not \r\ndo very much stuck up in a tall tree with wolves all round on the ground below. He gathered the huge \r\npine-cones from the branches of the tree. Then he set one alight with bright blue fire, and threw it \r\nwhizzing down among the circle of the wolves. It struck one on the back, and immediately his shaggy \r\ncoat caught fire, and he was leaping to and fro yelping horribly. Then another came and another, one \r\nin blue flames, one in red, another in green. They burst on the ground in the middle of the circle and \r\nwent off in coloured sparks and smoke. A specially large one hit the chief wolf on the nose, and he \r\nleaped in the air ten feet, and then rushed round and round the circle biting and snapping even at the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother wolves in his anger and fright. \r\n\r\nThe dwarves and Bilbo shouted and cheered. The rage of the wolves was terrible to see, and the \r\ncommotion they made filled all the forest. Wolves are afraid of fire at all times, but this was a most \r\nhorrible and uncanny fire. If a spark got in their coats it stuck and burned into them, and unless they \r\nrolled over quick they were soon all in flames. Very soon all about the glade wolves were rolling over \r\nand over to put out the sparks on their backs, while those that were burning were running about \r\nhowling and setting others alight, till their own friends chased them away and they fled off down the \r\nslopes crying and yammering and looking for water. \r\n\r\n\r\n“What is all this uproar in the forest tonight?” said the Lord of the Eagles. He was sitting, black in the \r\nmoonlight, on the top of a lonely pinnacle of rock at the eastern edge of the mountains. “I hear \r\nwolves’ voices! Are the goblins at mischief in the woods?” \r\n\r\nHe swept up into the air, and immediately two of his guards from the rocks at either hand leaped up \r\nto follow him. They circled up in the sky and looked down upon the ring of the Wargs, a tiny spot far \r\nfar below. But eagles have keen eyes and can see small things at a great distance. The Lord of the \r\nEagles of the Misty Mountains had eyes that could look at the sun unblinking, and could see a rabbit \r\nmoving on the ground a mile below even in the moonlight. So though he could not see the people in \r\nthe trees, he could make out the commotion among the wolves and see the tiny flashes of fire, and \r\nhear the howling and yelping come up faint from far beneath him. Also he could see the glint of the \r\nmoon on goblin spears and helmets, as long lines of the wicked folk crept down the hillsides from \r\ntheir gate and wound into the wood. \r\n\r\nEagles are not kindly birds. Some are cowardly and cruel. But the ancient race of the northern \r\nmountains were the greatest of all birds; they were proud and strong and noble-hearted. They did not \r\nlove goblins, or fear them. When they took any notice of them at all (which was seldom, for they did \r\nnot eat such creatures), they swooped on them and drove them shrieking back to their caves, and \r\nstopped whatever wickedness they were doing. The goblins hated the eagles and feared them, but \r\ncould not reach their lofty seats, or drive them from the mountains. \r\n\r\nTonight the Lord of the Eagles was filled with curiosity to know what was afoot; so he summoned \r\nmany other eagles to him, and they flew away from the mountains, and slowly circling ever round and \r\nround they came down, down, down towards the ring of the wolves and the meeting-place of the \r\ngoblins. \r\n\r\nA very good thing too! Dreadful things had been going on down there. The wolves that had caught \r\nfire and fled into the forest had set it alight in several places. It was high summer, and on this eastern \r\nside of the mountains there had been little rain for some time. Yellowing bracken, fallen branches, \r\ndeep-piled pine-needles, and here and there dead trees, were soon in flames. All round the clearing of \r\nthe Wargs fire was leaping. But the wolf-guards did not leave the trees. Maddened and angry they \r\nwere leaping and howling round the trunks, and cursing the dwarves in their horrible language, with \r\ntheir tongues hanging out, and their eyes shining as red and fierce as the flames. \r\n\r\nThen suddenly goblins came running up yelling. They thought a battle with the woodmen was \r\ngoing on; but they soon learned what had really happened. Some of them actually sat down and \r\nlaughed. Others waved their spears and clashed the shafts against their shields. Goblins are not afraid \r\nof fire, and they soon had a plan which seemed to them most amusing. \r\n\r\nSome got all the wolves together in a pack. Some stacked fern and brushwood round the tree- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrunks. Others rushed round and stamped and beat, and beat and stamped, until nearly all the flames \r\nwere put out — but they did not put out the fire nearest to the trees where the dwarves were. That fire \r\nthey fed with leaves and dead branches and bracken. Soon they had a ring of smoke and flame all \r\nround the dwarves, a ring which they kept from spreading outwards; but it closed slowly in, till the \r\nrunning fire was licking the fuel piled under the trees. Smoke was in Bilbo’s eyes, he could feel the \r\nheat of the flames; and through the reek he could see the goblins dancing round and round in a circle \r\nlike people round a midsummer bonfire. Outside the ring of dancing warriors with spears and axes \r\nstood the wolves at a respectful distance, watching and waiting. \r\n\r\nHe could hear the goblins beginning a horrible song: \r\n\r\n\r\nFifteen birds in five fir-trees, \r\n\r\ntheir feathers were fanned in a fiery breeze! \r\n\r\nBut, funny little birds, they had no wings! \r\n\r\nO what shall we do with the funny little things? Roast ’em alive, or stew them in a pot; \r\nfry them, boil them and eat them hot? \r\n\r\n\r\nThen they stopped and shouted out: “Fly away little birds! Fly away if you can! Come down little \r\nbirds, or you will get roasted in your nests! Sing, sing little birds! Why don’t you sing?” \r\n\r\n“Go away! little boys!” shouted Gandalf in answer. “It isn’t bird-nesting time. Also naughty little \r\nboys that play with fire get punished.” He said it to make them angry, and to show them he was not \r\nfrightened of them — though of course he was, wizard though he was. But they took no notice, and they \r\nwent on singing. \r\n\r\n\r\nBurn, burn tree and fern! \r\n\r\nShrivel and scorch! A fizzling torch \r\nTo light the night for our delight, \r\n\r\nYa hey! \r\n\r\nBake and toast ’em, fry and roast ’em! \r\ntill beards blaze, and eyes glaze; \r\ntill hair smells and skins crack, \r\nfat melts, and bones black \r\nin cinders lie \r\nbeneath the sky! \r\n\r\nSo dwarves shall die, \r\nand light the night for our delight, \r\n\r\nYa hey! \r\n\r\nYa-harri-hey! \r\n\r\nYa hoy! \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd with that Ya hoyl the flames were under Gandalf’ s tree. In a moment it spread to the others. \r\nThe bark caught fire, the lower branches cracked. \r\n\r\nThen Gandalf climbed to the top of his tree. The sudden splendour flashed from his wand like \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlightning, as he got ready to spring down from on high right among the spears of the goblins. That \r\nwould have been the end of him, though he would probably have killed many of them as he came \r\nhurtling down like a thunderbolt. But he never leaped. \r\n\r\nJust at that moment the Lord of the Eagles swept down from above, seized him in his talons, and \r\nwas gone. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a howl of anger and surprise from the goblins. Loud cried the Lord of the Eagles, to whom \r\nGandalf had now spoken. Back swept the great birds that were with him, and down they came like \r\nhuge black shadows. The wolves yammered and gnashed their teeth; the goblins yelled and stamped \r\nwith rage, and flung their heavy spears in the air in vain. Over them swooped the eagles; the dark rush \r\nof their beating wings smote them to the floor or drove them far away; their talons tore at goblin \r\nfaces. Other birds flew to the tree-tops and seized the dwarves, who were scrambling up now as far as \r\nthey ever dared to go. \r\n\r\nPoor little Bilbo was very nearly left behind again! He just managed to catch hold of Dori’s legs, as \r\nDori was borne off last of all; and up they went together above the tumult and the burning, Bilbo \r\nswinging in the air with his arms nearly breaking. \r\n\r\nNow far below the goblins and the wolves were scattering far and wide in the woods. A few eagles \r\nwere still circling and sweeping above the battleground. The flames about the trees sprang suddenly \r\nup above the highest branches. They went up in crackling fire. There was a sudden flurry of sparks and \r\nsmoke. Bilbo had escaped only just in time! \r\n\r\nSoon the light of the burning was faint below, a red twinkle on the black floor; and they were high \r\nup in the sky, rising all the time in strong sweeping circles. Bilbo never forgot that flight, clinging \r\nonto Dori’s ankles. He moaned “my arms, my arms!”; but Dori groaned “my poor legs, my poor legs!” \r\n\r\nAt the best of times heights made Bilbo giddy. He used to turn queer if he looked over the edge of \r\nquite a little cliff; and he had never liked ladders, let alone trees (never having had to escape from \r\nwolves before). So you can imagine how his head swam now, when he looked down between his \r\ndangling toes and saw the dark lands opening wide underneath him, touched here and there with the \r\nlight of the moon on a hill-side rock or a stream in the plains. \r\n\r\nThe pale peaks of the mountains were coming nearer, moonlit spikes of rock sticking out of black \r\nshadows. Summer or not, it seemed very cold. He shut his eyes and wondered if he could hold on any \r\nlonger. Then he imagined what would happen if he did not. He felt sick. \r\n\r\nThe flight ended only just in time for him, just before his arms gave way. He loosed Dori’s ankles \r\nwith a gasp and fell onto the rough platform of an eagle’s eyrie. There he lay without speaking, and his \r\nthoughts were a mixture of surprise at being saved from the fire, and fear lest he fall off that narrow \r\nplace into the deep shadows on either side. He was feeling very queer indeed in his head by this time \r\nafter the dreadful adventures of the last three days with next to nothing to eat, and he found himself \r\nsaying aloud: “Now I know what a piece of bacon feels like when it is suddenly picked out of the pan \r\non a fork and put back on the shelf!” \r\n\r\n“No you don’t!” he heard Dori answering, “because the bacon knows that it will get back in the pan \r\nsooner or later; and it is to be hoped we shan’t. Also eagles aren’t forks!” \r\n\r\n“O no! Not a bit like storks — forks, I mean,” said Bilbo sitting up and looking anxiously at the \r\neagle who was perched close by. He wondered what other nonsense he had been saying, and if the \r\neagle would think it rude. You ought not to be rude to an eagle, when you are only the size of a hobbit, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand are up in his eyrie at night! \r\n\r\nThe eagle only sharpened his beak on a stone and trimmed his feathers and took no notice. \r\n\r\nSoon another eagle flew up. “The Lord of the Eagles bids you to bring your prisoners to the Great \r\nShelf,” he cried and was off again. The other seized Dori in his claws and flew away with him into the \r\nnight leaving Bilbo all alone. He had just strength to wonder what the messenger had meant by \r\n‘prisoners,’ and to begin to think of being torn up for supper like a rabbit, when his own turn came. \r\n\r\nThe eagle came back, seized him in his talons by the back of his coat, and swooped off. This time \r\nhe flew only a short way. Very soon Bilbo was laid down, trembling with fear, on a wide shelf of rock \r\non the mountain-side. There was no path down on to it save by flying; and no path down off it except \r\nby jumping over a precipice. There he found all the others sitting with their backs to the mountain \r\nwall. The Lord of the Eagles also was there and was speaking to Gandalf. \r\n\r\nIt seemed that Bilbo was not going to be eaten after all. The wizard and the eagle-lord appeared to \r\nknow one another slightly, and even to be on friendly terms. As a matter of fact Gandalf, who had \r\noften been in the mountains, had once rendered a service to the eagles and healed their lord from an \r\narrow-wound. So you see ‘prisoners’ had meant ‘prisoners rescued from the goblins’ only, and not \r\ncaptives of the eagles. As Bilbo listened to the talk of Gandalf he realized that at last they were going \r\nto escape really and truly from the dreadful mountains. He was discussing plans with the Great Eagle \r\nfor carrying the dwarves and himself and Bilbo far away and setting them down well on their journey \r\nacross the plains below. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Misty Mountains Looking West from the Eyrie towards Goblin Gate \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lord of the Eagles would not take them anywhere near where men lived. “They would shoot at \r\nus with their great bows of yew,” he said, “for they would think we were after their sheep. And at other \r\ntimes they would be right. No! we are glad to cheat the goblins of their sport, and glad to repay our \r\nthanks to you, but we will not risk ourselves for dwarves in the southward plains.” \r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Gandalf. “Take us where and as far as you will! We are already deeply obliged to \r\nyou. But in the meantime we are famished with hunger.” \r\n\r\n\r\n“I am nearly dead of it,” said Bilbo in a weak little voice that nobody heard. \r\n\r\n“That can perhaps be mended,” said the Lord of the Eagles. \r\n\r\nLater on you might have seen a bright fire on the shelf of rock and the figures of the dwarves round \r\nit cooking and making a fine roasting smell. The eagles had brought up dry boughs for fuel, and they \r\nhad brought rabbits, hares, and a small sheep. The dwarves managed all the preparations. Bilbo was \r\ntoo weak to help, and anyway he was not much good at skinning rabbits or cutting up meat, being used \r\nto having it delivered by the butcher all ready to cook. Gandalf, too, was lying down after doing his \r\npart in setting the fire going, since Oin and Gloin had lost their tinder-boxes. (Dwarves have never \r\ntaken to matches even yet.) \r\n\r\nSo ended the adventures of the Misty Mountains. Soon Bilbo’s stomach was feeling full and \r\ncomfortable again, and he felt he could sleep contentedly, though really he would have liked a loaf and \r\nbutter better than bits of meat toasted on sticks. He slept curled up on the hard rock more soundly than \r\never he had done on his feather-bed in his own little hole at home. But all night he dreamed of his own \r\nhouse and wandered in his sleep into all his different rooms looking for something that he could not \r\nfind nor remember what it looked like."

    "ChapterData": "The next morning Bilbo woke up with the early sun in his eyes. He jumped up to look at the time and \r\nto go and put his kettle on — and found he was not home at all. So he sat down and wished in vain for a \r\nwash and a brush. He did not get either, nor tea nor toast nor bacon for his breakfast, only cold mutton \r\nand rabbit. And after that he had to get ready for a fresh start. \r\n\r\nThis time he was allowed to climb on to an eagle’s back and cling between his wings. The air \r\nrushed over him and he shut his eyes. The dwarves were crying farewells and promising to repay the \r\nLord of the Eagles if ever they could, as off rose fifteen great birds from the mountain’s side. The sun \r\nwas still close to the eastern edge of things. The morning was cool, and mists were in the valleys and \r\nhollows and twined here and there about the peaks and pinnacles of the hills. Bilbo opened an eye to \r\npeep and saw that the birds were already high up and the world was far away, and the mountains were \r\nfalling back behind them into the distance. He shut his eyes again and held on tighter. \r\n\r\n“Don’t pinch!” said his eagle. “You need not be frightened like a rabbit, even if you look rather \r\nlike one. It is a fair morning with little wind. What is finer than flying?” \r\n\r\nBilbo would have liked to say: “A warm bath and late breakfast on the lawn afterwards;” but he \r\nthought it better to say nothing at all, and to let go his clutch just a tiny bit. \r\n\r\nAfter a good while the eagles must have seen the point they were making for, even from their great \r\nheight, for they began to go down circling round in great spirals. They did this for a long while, and at \r\nlast the hobbit opened his eyes again. The earth was much nearer, and below them were trees that \r\nlooked like oaks and elms, and wide grass lands, and a river running through it all. But cropping out of \r\nthe ground, right in the path of the stream which looped itself about it, was a great rock, almost a hill \r\nof stone, like a last outpost of the distant mountains, or a huge piece cast miles into the plain by some \r\ngiant among giants. \r\n\r\nQuickly now to the top of this rock the eagles swooped one by one and set down their passengers. \r\n\r\n“Farewell!” they cried, “wherever you fare, till your eyries receive you at the journey’s end!” That \r\nis the polite thing to say among eagles. \r\n\r\n“May the wind under your wings bear you where the sun sails and the moon walks,” answered \r\nGandalf, who knew the correct reply. \r\n\r\nAnd so they parted. And though the Lord of the Eagles became in after days the King of All Birds \r\nand wore a golden crown, and his fifteen chieftains golden collars (made of the gold that the dwarves \r\ngave them), Bilbo never saw them again — except high and far off in the battle of Five Armies. But as \r\nthat comes in at the end of this tale we will say no more about it just now. \r\n\r\nThere was a flat space on the top of the hill of stone and a well worn path with many steps leading \r\ndown it to the river, across which a ford of huge flat stones led to the grass-land beyond the stream. \r\nThere was a little cave (a wholesome one with a pebbly floor) at the foot of the steps and near the end \r\nof the stony ford. Here the party gathered and discussed what was to be done. \r\n\r\n“I always meant to see you all safe (if possible) over the mountains,” said the wizard, “and now by \r\ngood management and good luck I have done it. Indeed we are now a good deal further east than I ever \r\n\r\n\r\nmeant to come with you, for after all this is not my adventure. I may look in on it again before it is all \r\nover, but in the meanwhile I have some other pressing business to attend to.” \r\n\r\nThe dwarves groaned and looked most distressed, and Bilbo wept. They had begun to think Gandalf \r\nwas going to come all the way and would always be there to help them out of difficulties. “I am not \r\ngoing to disappear this very instant,” said he. “I can give you a day or two more. Probably I can help \r\nyou out of your present plight, and I need a little help myself. We have no food, and no baggage, and \r\nno ponies to ride; and you don’t know where you are. Now I can tell you that. You are still some miles \r\nnorth of the path which we should have been following, if we had not left the mountain pass in a hurry. \r\nVery few people live in these parts, unless they have come here since I was last down this way, which \r\nis some years ago. But there is somebody that I know of, who lives not far away. That Somebody made \r\nthe steps on the great rock — the Carrock I believe he calls it. He does not come here often, certainly \r\nnot in the daytime, and it is no good waiting for him. In fact it would be very dangerous. We must go \r\nand find him; and if all goes well at our meeting, I think I shall be off and wish you like the eagles \r\n'farewell wherever you fare!’” \r\n\r\nThey begged him not to leave them. They offered him dragon-gold and silver and jewels, but he \r\nwould not change his mind. “We shall see, we shall see!” he said, “and I think I have earned already \r\nsome of your dragon-gold — when you have got it.” \r\n\r\n\r\nAfter that they stopped pleading. Then they took off their clothes and bathed in the river, which was \r\nshallow and clear and stony at the ford. When they had dried in the sun, which was now strong and \r\nwarm, they were refreshed, if still sore and a little hungry. Soon they crossed the ford (carrying the \r\nhobbit), and then began to march through the long green grass and down the lines of the wide-armed \r\noaks and the tall elms. \r\n\r\n“And why is it called the Carrock?” asked Bilbo as he went along at the wizard’s side. \r\n\r\n“He called it the Carrock, because carrock is his word for it. He calls things like that carrocks, and \r\nthis one is the Carrock because it is the only one near his home and he knows it well.” \r\n\r\n“Who calls it? Who knows it?” \r\n\r\n“The Somebody I spoke of — a very great person. You must all be very polite when I introduce you. \r\nI shall introduce you slowly, two by two, I think; and you must be careful not to annoy him, or heaven \r\nknows what will happen. He can be appalling when he is angry, though he is kind enough if humoured. \r\nStill I warn you he gets angry easily.” \r\n\r\nThe dwarves all gathered round when they heard the wizard talking like this to Bilbo. “Is that the \r\nperson you are taking us to now?” they asked. “Couldn’t you find someone more easy-tempered? \r\nHadn’t you better explain it all a bit clearer?” — and so on. \r\n\r\n“Yes it certainly is! No I could not! And I was explaining very carefully,” answered the wizard \r\ncrossly. “If you must know more, his name is Beorn. He is very strong, and he is a skin-changer.” \r\n\r\n“What! a furrier, a man that calls rabbits conies, when he doesn’t turn their skins into squirrels?” \r\nasked Bilbo. \r\n\r\n“Good gracious heavens, no, no, NO, NO!” said Gandalf. “Don’t be a fool Mr. Baggins if you can \r\nhelp it; and in the name of all wonder don’t mention the word furrier again as long as you are within a \r\nhundred miles of his house, nor rug, cape, tippet, muff, nor any other such unfortunate word! He is a \r\nskin-changer. He changes his skin: sometimes he is a huge black bear, sometimes he is a great strong \r\nblack-haired man with huge arms and a great beard. I cannot tell you much more, though that ought to \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe enough. Some say that he is a bear descended from the great and ancient bears of the mountains \r\nthat lived there before the giants came. Others say that he is a man descended from the first men who \r\nlived before Smaug or the other dragons came into this part of the world, and before the goblins came \r\ninto the hills out of the North. I cannot say, though I fancy the last is the true tale. He is not the sort of \r\nperson to ask questions of. \r\n\r\n“At any rate he is under no enchantment but his own. He lives in an oak-wood and has a great \r\nwooden house; and as a man he keeps cattle and horses which are nearly as marvellous as himself. \r\nThey work for him and talk to him. He does not eat them; neither does he hunt or eat wild animals. He \r\nkeeps hives and hives of great fierce bees, and lives most on cream and honey. As a bear he ranges far \r\nand wide. I once saw him sitting all alone on the top of the Carrock at night watching the moon \r\nsinking towards the Misty Mountains, and I heard him growl in the tongue of bears: The day will \r\ncome when they will perish and I shall go back! ’ That is why I believe he once came from the \r\nmountains himself.” \r\n\r\n\r\nBilbo and the dwarves had now plenty to think about, and they asked no more questions. They still had \r\na long way to walk before them. Up slope and down dale they plodded. It grew very hot. Sometimes \r\nthey rested under the trees, and then Bilbo felt so hungry that he would have eaten acorns, if any had \r\nbeen ripe enough yet to have fallen to the ground. \r\n\r\nIt was the middle of the afternoon before they noticed that great patches of flowers had begun to \r\nspring up, all the same kinds growing together as if they had been planted. Especially there was \r\nclover, waving patches of cockscomb clover, and purple clover, and wide stretches of short white \r\nsweet honey-smelling clover. There was a buzzing and a whirring and a droning in the air. Bees were \r\nbusy everywhere. And such bees! Bilbo had never seen anything like them. \r\n\r\n“If one was to sting me,” he thought, “I should swell up as big again as lam!” \r\n\r\nThey were bigger than hornets. The drones were bigger than your thumb, a good deal, and the \r\nbands of yellow on their deep black bodies shone like fiery gold. \r\n\r\n“We are getting near,” said Gandalf. “We are on the edge of his bee-pastures.” \r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a while they came to a belt of tall and very ancient oaks, and beyond these to a high thorn-hedge \r\nthrough which you could neither see nor scramble. \r\n\r\n“You had better wait here,” said the wizard to the dwarves; “and when I call or whistle begin to \r\ncome after me — you will see the way I go — but only in pairs, mind, about five minutes between each \r\npair of you. Bombur is fattest and will do for two, he had better come alone and last. Come on Mr. \r\nBaggins! There is a gate somewhere round this way.” And with that he went off along the hedge taking \r\nthe frightened hobbit with him. \r\n\r\nThey soon came to a wooden gate, high and broad, beyond which they could see gardens and a \r\ncluster of low wooden buildings, some thatched and made of unshaped logs: barns, stables, sheds, and \r\na long low wooden house. Inside on the southward side of the great hedge were rows and rows of hives \r\nwith bell-shaped tops made of straw. The noise of the giant bees flying to and fro and crawling in and \r\nout filled all the air. \r\n\r\nThe wizard and the hobbit pushed open the heavy creaking gate and went down a wide track \r\ntowards the house. Some horses, very sleek and well-groomed, trotted up across the grass and looked \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat them intently with very intelligent faces; then off they galloped to the buildings. \r\n\r\n“They have gone to tell him of the arrival of strangers,” said Gandalf. \r\n\r\nSoon they reached a courtyard, three walls of which were formed by the wooden house and its two \r\nlong wings. In the middle there was lying a great oak-trunk with many lopped branches beside it. \r\nStanding near was a huge man with a thick black beard and hair, and great bare arms and legs with \r\nknotted muscles. He was clothed in a tunic of wool down to his knees, and was leaning on a large axe. \r\nThe horses were standing by him with their noses at his shoulder. \r\n\r\n“Ugh! here they are!” he said to the horses. “They don’t look dangerous. You can be off!” He \r\nlaughed a great rolling laugh, put down his axe and came forward. \r\n\r\n“Who are you and what do you want?” he asked gruffly, standing in front of them and towering tall \r\nabove Gandalf. As for Bilbo he could easily have trotted through his legs without ducking his head to \r\nmiss the fringe of the man’s brown tunic. \r\n\r\n“I am Gandalf,” said the wizard. \r\n\r\n“Never heard of him,” growled the man. “And what’s this little fellow?” he said, stooping down to \r\nfrown at the hobbit with his bushy black eyebrows. \r\n\r\n“That is Mr. Baggins, a hobbit of good family and unimpeachable reputation,” said Gandalf. Bilbo \r\nbowed. He had no hat to take off, and was painfully conscious of his many missing buttons. “I am a \r\nwizard,” continued Gandalf. “I have heard of you, if you have not heard of me; but perhaps you have \r\nheard of my good cousin Radagast who lives near the Southern borders of Mirkwood?” \r\n\r\n“Yes; not a bad fellow as wizards go, I believe. I used to see him now and again,” said Beorn. \r\n“Well, now I know who you are, or who you say you are. What do you want?” \r\n\r\n“To tell you the truth, we have lost our luggage and nearly lost our way, and are rather in need of \r\nhelp, or at least of advice. I may say we have had rather a bad time with goblins in the mountains.” \r\n\r\n“Goblins?” said the big man less gruffly. “O ho, so you’ve been having trouble with them have \r\nyou? What did you go near them for?” \r\n\r\n“We did not mean to. They surprised us at night in a pass which we had to cross; we were coming \r\nout of the Lands over West into these countries — it is a long tale.” \r\n\r\n“Then you had better come inside and tell me some of it, if it won’t take all day,” said the man \r\nleading the way through a dark door that opened out of the courtyard into the house. \r\n\r\nFollowing him they found themselves in a wide hall with a fire-place in the middle. Though it was \r\nsummer there was a wood-fire burning and the smoke was rising to the blackened rafters in search of \r\nthe way out through an opening in the roof. They passed through this dim hall, lit only by the fire and \r\nthe hole above it, and came through another smaller door into a sort of veranda propped on wooden \r\nposts made of single tree-trunks. It faced south and was still warm and filled with the light of the \r\nwestering sun which slanted into it, and fell golden on the garden full of flowers that came right up to \r\nthe steps. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere th \r\nand lookec \r\nhalf of the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I was coming over the mountains with a friend or two...” said the wizard. \r\n\r\n“Or two? I can only see one, and a little one at that,” said Beorn. \r\n\r\n“Well to tell you the truth, I did not like to bother you with a lot of us, until I found out if you were \r\nbusy. I will give a call, if I may.” \r\n\r\n“Go on, call away!” \r\n\r\nSo Gandalf gave a long shrill whistle, and presently Thorin and Dori came round the house by the \r\ngarden path and stood bowing low before them. \r\n\r\n“One or three you meant, I see!” said Beorn. “But these aren’t hobbits, they are dwarves!” \r\n\r\n“Thorin Oakenshield, at your service! Dori at your service!” said the two dwarves bowing again. \r\n\r\n“I don’t need your service, thank you,” said Beorn, “but I expect you need mine. I am not over fond \r\nof dwarves; but if it is true you are Thorin (son of Thrain, son of Thror, I believe), and that your \r\ncompanion is respectable, and that you are enemies of goblins and are not up to any mischief in my \r\nlands — what are you up to, by the way?” \r\n\r\n“They are on their way to visit the land of their fathers, away east beyond Mirkwood,” put in \r\nGandalf, “and it is entirely an accident that we are in your lands at all. We were crossing by the High \r\nPass that should have brought us to the road that lies to the south of your country, when we were \r\nattacked by the evil goblins — as I was about to tell you.” \r\n\r\n“Go on telling, then!” said Beorn, who was never very polite. \r\n\r\n“There was a terrible storm; the stone-giants were out hurling rocks, and at the head of the pass we \r\ntook refuge in a cave, the hobbit and I and several of our companions...” \r\n\r\n“Do you call two several?” \r\n\r\n“Well, no. As a matter of fact there were more than two.” \r\n\r\n“Where are they? Killed, eaten, gone home?” “Well, no. They don’t seem all to have come when I \r\nwhistled. Shy, I expect. You see, we are very much afraid that we are rather a lot for you to entertain.” \r\n\r\n“Go on, whistle again! I am in for a party, it seems, and one or two more won’t make much \r\ndifference,” growled Beorn. \r\n\r\nGandalf whistled again; but Nori and Ori were there almost before he had stopped, for, if you \r\nremember, Gandalf had told them to come in pairs every five minutes. \r\n\r\n“Hullo!” said Beorn. “You came pretty quick — where were you hiding? Come on my jack-in-the- \r\nboxes!” \r\n\r\n“Nori at your service, Ori at...” they began; but Beorn interrupted them. \r\n\r\n“Thank you! When I want your help I will ask for it. Sit down, and let’s get on with this tale, or it \r\nwill be supper-time before it is ended.” \r\n\r\n“As soon as we were asleep,” went on Gandalf, “a crack at the back of the cave opened; goblins \r\ncame out and grabbed the hobbit and the dwarves and our troop of ponies — ” \r\n\r\n“Troop of ponies? What were you — a travelling circus? Or were you carrying lots of goods? Or do \r\nyou always call six a troop?” \r\n\r\n“O no! As a matter of fact there were more than six ponies, for there were more than six of us — and \r\nwell, here are two more!” Just at that moment Balin and Dwalin appeared and bowed so low that their \r\nbeards swept the stone floor. The big man was frowning at first, but they did their best to be \r\nfrightfully polite, and kept on nodding and bending and bowing and waving their hoods before their \r\nknees (in proper dwarf-fashion), till he stopped frowning and burst into a chuckling laugh: they looked \r\nso comical. \r\n\r\n“Troop, was right,” he said. “A fine comic one. Come in my merry men, and what are your names? \r\n\r\nI don’t want your service just now, only your names; and then sit down and stop wagging!” \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Balin and Dwalin,” they said not daring to be offended, and sat flop on the floor looking rather \r\nsurprised. \r\n\r\n“Now go on again!” said Beorn to the wizard. “Where was I? O yes — I was not grabbed. I killed a \r\ngoblin or two with a flash — ” \r\n\r\n“Good!” growled Beorn. “It is some good being a wizard, then.” \r\n\r\n“ — and slipped inside the crack before it closed. I followed down into the main hall, which was \r\ncrowded with goblins. The Great Goblin was there with thirty or forty armed guards. I thought to \r\nmyself ‘even if they were not all chained together, what can a dozen do against so many?”’ \r\n\r\n“A dozen! That’s the first time I’ve heard eight called a dozen. Or have you still got some more \r\njacks that haven’t yet come out of their boxes?” \r\n\r\n“Well, yes, there seem to be a couple more here now — Fili and Kili, I believe,” said Gandalf, as \r\nthese two now appeared and stood smiling and bowing. \r\n\r\n“That’s enough!” said Beorn. “Sit down and be quiet! Now go on, Gandalf!” \r\n\r\nSo Gandalf went on with the tale, until he came to the fight in the dark, the discovery of the lower \r\ngate, and their horror when they found that Mr. Baggins had been mislaid. “We counted ourselves and \r\nfound that there was no hobbit. There were only fourteen of us left!” \r\n\r\n“Fourteen! That’s the first time I’ve heard one from ten leave fourteen. You mean nine, or else you \r\nhaven’t told me yet all the names of your party.” \r\n\r\n“Well, of course you haven’t seen Oin and Gloin yet. And, bless me! here they are. I hope you will \r\nforgive them for bothering you.” \r\n\r\n“O let ’em all come! Hurry up! Come along, you two, and sit down! But look here, Gandalf, even \r\nnow we have only got yourself and ten dwarves and the hobbit that was lost. That only makes eleven \r\n(plus one mislaid) and not fourteen, unless wizards count differently to other people. But now please \r\nget on with the tale.” Beorn did not show it more than he could help, but really he had begun to get \r\nvery interested. You see, in the old days he had known the very part of the mountains that Gandalf was \r\ndescribing. He nodded and he growled, when he heard of the hobbit’s reappearance and of their \r\nscramble down the stone-slide and of the wolf-ring in the woods. \r\n\r\nWhen Gandalf came to their climbing into trees with the wolves all underneath, he got up and \r\nstrode about and muttered: “I wish I had been there! I would have given them more than fireworks!” \r\n\r\n“Well,” said Gandalf very glad to see that his tale was making a good impression, “I did the best I \r\ncould. There we were with the wolves going mad underneath us and the forest beginning to blaze in \r\nplaces, when the goblins came down from the hills and discovered us. They yelled with delight and \r\nsang songs making fun of us. Fifteen birds in five fir-trees ...” \r\n\r\n“Good heavens!” growled Beorn. “Don’t pretend that goblins can’t count. They can. Twelve isn’t \r\nfifteen and they know it.” \r\n\r\n“And so do I. There were Bifur and Bofur as well. I haven’t ventured to introduce them before, but \r\nhere they are.” \r\n\r\nIn came Bifur and Bofur. “And me!” gasped Bombur puffing up behind. He was fat, and also angry \r\nat being left till last. He refused to wait five minutes, and followed immediately after the other two. \r\n\r\n“Well, now there are fifteen of you; and since goblins can count, I suppose that is all that there \r\nwere up the trees. Now perhaps we can finish this story without any more interruptions.” Mr. Baggins \r\nsaw then how clever Gandalf had been. The interruptions had really made Beorn more interested in the \r\nstory, and the story had kept him from sending the dwarves off at once like suspicious beggars. He \r\nnever invited people into his house, if he could help it. He had very few friends and they lived a good \r\nway away; and he never invited more than a couple of these to his house at a time. Now he had got \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfifteen strangers sitting in his porch! \r\n\r\nBy the time the wizard had finished his tale and had told of the eagles’ rescue and of how they had \r\nall been brought to the Carrock, the sun had fallen behind the peaks of the Misty Mountains and the \r\nshadows were long in Beorn’s garden. \r\n\r\n“A very good tale!” said he. “The best I have heard for a long while. If all beggars could tell such a \r\ngood one, they might find me kinder. You may be making it all up, of course, but you deserve a supper \r\nfor the story all the same. Let’s have something to eat!” \r\n\r\n“Yes please!” they all said together. “Thank you very much!” \r\n\r\n\r\nInside the hall it was now quite dark. Beorn clapped his hands, and in trotted four beautiful white \r\nponies and several large long-bodied grey dogs. Beorn said something to them in a queer language like \r\nanimal noises turned into talk. They went out again and soon came back carrying torches in their \r\nmouths, which they lit at the fire and stuck in low brackets on the pillars of the hall about the central \r\nhearth. The dogs could stand on their hind-legs when they wished, and carry things with their fore- \r\nfeet. Quickly they got out boards and trestles from the side walls and set them up near the fire. \r\n\r\nThen baa — baa — baa! was heard, and in came some snow-white sheep led by a large coal-black \r\nram. One bore a white cloth embroidered at the edges with figures of animals; others bore on their \r\nbroad backs trays with bowls and platters and knives and wooden spoons, which the dogs took and \r\nquickly laid on the trestle-tables. These were very low, low enough even for Bilbo to sit at \r\ncomfortably. Beside them a pony pushed two low-seated benches with wide rush-bottoms and little \r\nshort thick legs for Gandalf and Thorin, while at the far end he put Beorn’s big black chair of the same \r\nsort (in which he sat with his great legs stuck far out under the table). These were all the chairs he had \r\nin his hall, and he probably had them low like the tables for the convenience of the wonderful animals \r\nthat waited on him. What did the rest sit on? They were not forgotten. The other ponies came in \r\nrolling round drum-shaped sections of logs, smoothed and polished, and low enough even for Bilbo; so \r\nsoon they were all seated at Beorn’s table, and the hall had not seen such a gathering for many a year. \r\n\r\nThere they had a supper, or a dinner, such as they had not had since they left the Last Homely \r\nHouse in the West and said good-bye to Elrond. The light of the torches and the fire flickered about \r\nthem, and on the table were two tall red beeswax candles. All the time they ate, Beorn in his deep \r\nrolling voice told tales of the wild lands on this side of the mountains, and especially of the dark and \r\ndangerous wood, that lay outstretched far to North and South a day’s ride before them, barring their \r\nway to the East, the terrible forest of Mirkwood. \r\n\r\nThe dwarves listened and shook their beards, for they knew that they must soon venture into that \r\nforest and that after the mountains it was the worst of the perils they had to pass before they came to \r\nthe dragon’s stronghold. When dinner was over they began to tell tales of their own, but Beorn seemed \r\nto be growing drowsy and paid little heed to them. They spoke most of gold and silver and jewels and \r\nthe making of things by smith-craft, and Beorn did not appear to care for such things: there were no \r\nthings of gold or silver in his hall, and few save the knives were made of metal at all. \r\n\r\nThey sat long at the table with their wooden drinking-bowls filled with mead. The dark night came \r\non outside. The fires in the middle of the hall were built with fresh logs and the torches were put out, \r\nand still they sat in the light of the dancing flames with the pillars of the house standing tall behind \r\nthem, and dark at the top like trees of the forest. Whether it was magic or not, it seemed to Bilbo that \r\nhe heard a sound like wind in the branches stirring in the rafters, and the hoot of owls. Soon he began \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto nod with sleep and the voices seemed to grow far away, until he woke with a start. \r\n\r\nThe great door had creaked and slammed. Beorn was gone. The dwarves were sitting cross-legged \r\non the floor round the fire, and presently they began to sing. Some of the verses were like this, but \r\nthere were many more, and their singing went on for a long while: \r\n\r\n\r\nThe wind was on the withered heath, \r\nbut in the forest stirred no leaf: \r\nthere shadows lay by night and day, \r\nand dark things silent crept beneath. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe wind came down from mountains cold, \r\nand like a tide it roared and rolled; \r\nthe branches groaned, the forest moaned, \r\nand leaves were laid upon the mould. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe wind went on from West to East; \r\nall movement in the forest ceased, \r\nbut shrill and harsh across the marsh \r\nits whistling voices were released. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe grasses hissed, their tassels bent, \r\nthe reeds were rattling — on it went \r\no’er shaken pool under heavens cool \r\nwhere racing clouds were torn and rent. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt passed the lonely Mountain bare \r\nand swept above the dragon’s lair: \r\nthere black and dark lay boulders stark \r\nand flying smoke was in the air. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt left the world and took its flight \r\nover the wide seas of the night. \r\n\r\nThe moon set sail upon the gale, \r\nand stars were fanned to leaping light. \r\n\r\n\r\nBilbo began to nod again. Suddenly up stood Gandalf. \r\n\r\n“It is time for us to sleep,” he said, “ — for us, but not I think for Beorn. In this hall we can rest \r\nsound and safe, but I warn you all not to forget what Beorn said before he left us: you must not stray \r\noutside until the sun is up, on your peril.” \r\n\r\nBilbo found that beds had already been laid at the side of the hall, on a sort of raised platform \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetween the pillars and the outer wall. For him there was a little mattress of straw and woollen \r\nblankets. He snuggled into them very gladly, summertime though it was. The fire burned low and he \r\nfell asleep. Yet in the night he woke: the fire had now sunk to a few embers; the dwarves and Gandalf \r\nwere all asleep, to judge by their breathing; a splash of white on the floor came from the high moon, \r\nwhich was peering down through the smoke-hole in the roof. \r\n\r\nThere was a growling sound outside, and a noise as of some great animal scuffling at the door. \r\nBilbo wondered what it was, and whether it could be Beorn in enchanted shape, and if he would come \r\nin as a bear and kill them. He dived under the blankets and hid his head, and fell asleep again at last in \r\nspite of his fears. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt was full morning when he awoke. One of the dwarves had fallen over him in the shadows where he \r\nlay, and had rolled down with a bump from the platform on to the floor. It was Bofur, and he was \r\ngrumbling about it, when Bilbo opened his eyes. \r\n\r\n“Get up lazybones,” he said, “or there will be no breakfast left for you.” \r\n\r\nUp jumped Bilbo. “Breakfast!” he cried. “Where is breakfast?” \r\n\r\n“Mostly inside us,” answered the other dwarves who were moving about the hall; “but what is left \r\nis out on the veranda. We have been about looking for Beorn ever since the sun got up; but there is no \r\nsign of him anywhere, though we found breakfast laid as soon as we went out.” \r\n\r\n“Where is Gandalf?” asked Bilbo, moving off to find something to eat as quick as he could. \r\n\r\n“O! out and about somewhere,” they told him. But he saw no sign of the wizard all that day until \r\nthe evening. Just before sunset he walked into the hall, where the hobbit and the dwarves were having \r\nsupper, waited on by Beorn’ s wonderful animals, as they had been all day. Of Beorn they had seen and \r\nheard nothing since the night before, and they were getting puzzled. \r\n\r\n“Where is our host, and where have you been all day yourself?” they all cried. \r\n\r\n“One question at a time — and none till after supper! I haven’t had a bite since breakfast.” \r\n\r\nAt last Gandalf pushed away his plate and jug — he had eaten two whole loaves (with masses of \r\nbutter and honey and clotted cream) and drunk at least a quart of mead — and he took out his pipe. “I \r\nwill answer the second question first,” he said, “ — but bless me! this is a splendid place for smoke \r\nrings!” Indeed for a long time they could get nothing more out of him, he was so busy sending smoke \r\nrings dodging round the pillars of the hall, changing them into all sorts of different shapes and \r\ncolours, and setting them at last chasing one another out of the hole in the roof. They must have \r\nlooked very queer from outside, popping out into the air one after another, green, blue, red, silver- \r\ngrey, yellow, white; big ones, little ones; little ones dodging through big ones and joining into figure- \r\neights, and going off like a flock of birds into the distance. \r\n\r\n“I have been picking out bear-tracks,” he said at last. “There must have been a regular bears’ \r\nmeeting outside here last night. I soon saw that Beorn could not have made them all: there were far \r\ntoo many of them, and they were of various sizes too. I should say there were little bears, large bears, \r\nordinary bears, and gigantic big bears, all dancing outside from dark to nearly dawn. They came from \r\nalmost every direction, except from the west over the river, from the Mountains. In that direction only \r\none set of footprints led — none coming, only ones going away from here. I followed these as far as the \r\nCarrock. There they disappeared into the river, but the water was too deep and strong beyond the rock \r\nfor me to cross. It is easy enough, as you remember, to get from this bank to the Carrock by the ford, \r\nbut on the other side is a cliff standing up from a swirling channel. I had to walk miles before I found \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na place where the river was wide and shallow enough for me to wade and swim, and then miles back \r\nagain to pick up the tracks again. By that time it was too late for me to follow them far. They went \r\nstraight off in the direction of the pine-woods on the east side of the Misty Mountains, where we had \r\nour pleasant little party with the Wargs the night before last. And now I think I have answered your \r\nfirst question, too,” ended Gandalf, and he sat a long while silent. \r\n\r\nBilbo thought he knew what the wizard meant. “What shall we do,” he cried, “if he leads all the \r\nWargs and the goblins down here? We shall all be caught and killed! I thought you said he was not a \r\nfriend of theirs.” \r\n\r\n“So I did. And don’t be silly! You had better go to bed, your wits are sleepy.” \r\n\r\nThe hobbit felt quite crushed, and as there seemed nothing else to do he did go to bed; and while \r\nthe dwarves were still singing songs he dropped asleep, still puzzling his little head about Beorn, till \r\nhe dreamed a dream of hundreds of black bears dancing slow heavy dances round and round in the \r\nmoonlight in the courtyard. Then he woke up when everyone else was asleep, and he heard the same \r\nscraping, scuffling, snuffling, and growling as before. \r\n\r\nNext morning they were all wakened by Beorn himself. “So here you all are still!” he said. He \r\npicked up the hobbit and laughed: “Not eaten up by Wargs or goblins or wicked bears yet I see”; and \r\nhe poked Mr. Baggins’ waistcoat most disrespectfully. “Little bunny is getting nice and fat again on \r\nbread and honey,” he chuckled. “Come and have some more!” \r\n\r\nSo they all went to breakfast with him. Beorn was most jolly for a change; indeed he seemed to be \r\nin a splendidly good humour and set them all laughing with his funny stories; nor did they have to \r\nwonder long where he had been or why he was so nice to them, for he told them himself. He had been \r\nover the river and right back up into the mountains — from which you can guess that he could travel \r\nquickly, in bear’s shape at any rate. From the burnt wolf-glade he had soon found out that part of their \r\nstory was true; but he had found more than that: he had caught a Warg and a goblin wandering in the \r\nwoods. From these he had got news: the goblin patrols were still hunting with Wargs for the dwarves, \r\nand they were fiercely angry because of the death of the Great Goblin, and also because of the burning \r\nof the chief wolf’s nose and the death from the wizard’s fire of many of his chief servants. So much \r\nthey told him when he forced them, but he guessed there was more wickedness than this afoot, and \r\nthat a great raid of the whole goblin army with their wolf-allies into the lands shadowed by the \r\nmountains might soon be made to find the dwarves, or to take vengeance on the men and creatures that \r\nlived there, and who they thought must be sheltering them. \r\n\r\n“It was a good story, that of yours,” said Beorn, “but I like it still better now I am sure it is true. \r\nYou must forgive my not taking your word. If you lived near the edge of Mirkwood, you would take \r\nthe word of no one that you did not know as well as your brother or better. As it is, I can only say that \r\nI have hurried home as fast as I could to see that you were safe, and to offer you any help that I can. I \r\nshall think more kindly of dwarves after this. Killed the Great Goblin, killed the Great Goblin!” he \r\nchuckled fiercely to himself. \r\n\r\n“What did you do with the goblin and the Warg?” asked Bilbo suddenly. \r\n\r\n“Come and see!” said Beorn, and they followed round the house. A goblin’s head was stuck outside \r\nthe gate and a warg-skin was nailed to a tree just beyond. Beorn was a fierce enemy. But now he was \r\ntheir friend, and Gandalf thought it wise to tell him their whole story and the reason of their journey, \r\nso that they could get the most help he could offer. \r\n\r\nThis is what he promised to do for them. He would provide ponies for each of them, and a horse for \r\nGandalf, for their journey to the forest, and he would lade them with food to last them for weeks with \r\ncare, and packed so as to be as easy as possible to carry — nuts, flour, sealed jars of dried fruits, and \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nred earthenware pots of honey, and twice-baked cakes that would keep good a long time, and on a little \r\nof which they could march far. The making of these was one of his secrets; but honey was in them, as \r\nin most of his foods, and they were good to eat, though they made one thirsty. Water, he said, they \r\nwould not need to carry this side of the forest, for there were streams and springs along the road. “But \r\nyour way through Mirkwood is dark, dangerous and difficult,” he said. “Water is not easy to find \r\nthere, nor food. The time is not yet come for nuts (though it may be past and gone indeed before you \r\nget to the other side), and nuts are about all that grows there fit for food; in there the wild things are \r\ndark, queer, and savage. I will provide you with skins for carrying water, and I will give you some \r\nbows and arrows. But I doubt very much whether anything you find in Mirkwood will be wholesome \r\nto eat or to drink. There is one stream there, I know, black and strong which crosses the path. That you \r\nshould neither drink of, nor bathe in; for I have heard that it carries enchantment and a great \r\ndrowsiness and forgetfulness. And in the dim shadows of that place I don’t think you will shoot \r\nanything, wholesome or unwholesome, without straying from the path. That you MUST NOT do, for \r\nany reason. \r\n\r\n“That is all the advice I can give you. Beyond the edge of the forest I cannot help you much; you \r\nmust depend on your luck and your courage and the food I send with you. At the gate of the forest I \r\nmust ask you to send back my horse and my ponies. But I wish you all speed, and my house is open to \r\nyou, if ever you come back this way again.” \r\n\r\n\r\nThey thanked him, of course, with many bows and sweepings of their hoods and with many an “at your \r\nservice, O master of the wide wooden halls!” But their spirits sank at his grave words, and they all felt \r\nthat the adventure was far more dangerous than they had thought, while all the time, even if they \r\npassed all the perils of the road, the dragon was waiting at the end. \r\n\r\nAll that morning they were busy with preparations. Soon after midday they ate with Beorn for the \r\nlast time, and after the meal they mounted the steeds he was lending them, and bidding him many \r\nfarewells they rode off through his gate at a good pace. \r\n\r\nAs soon as they left his high hedges at the east of his fenced lands they turned north and then bore \r\nto the north-west. By his advice they were no longer making for the main forest-road to the south of \r\nhis land. Had they followed the pass, their path would have led them down a stream from the \r\nmountains that joined the great river miles south of the Carrock. At that point there was a deep ford \r\nwhich they might have passed, if they had still had their ponies, and beyond that a track led to the \r\nskirts of the wood and to the entrance of the old forest road. But Beorn had warned them that that way \r\nwas now often used by the goblins, while the forest-road itself, he had heard, was overgrown and \r\ndisused at the eastern end and led to impassable marshes where the paths had long been lost. Its \r\neastern opening had also always been far to the south of the Lonely Mountain, and would have left \r\nthem still with a long and difficult northward march when they got to the other side. North of the \r\nCarrock the edge of Mirkwood drew closer to the borders of the Great River, and though here the \r\nMountains too drew down nearer, Beorn advised them to take this way; for at a place a few days’ ride \r\ndue north of the Carrock was the gate of a little-known pathway through Mirkwood that led almost \r\nstraight towards the Lonely Mountain. \r\n\r\n“The goblins,” Beorn had said, “will not dare to cross the Great River for a hundred miles north of \r\nthe Carrock nor to come near my house — it is well protected at night! — but I should ride fast; for if \r\nthey make their raid soon they will cross the river to the south and scour all the edge of the forest so as \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto cut you off, and Wargs run swifter than ponies. Still you are safer going north, even though you \r\nseem to be going back nearer to their strongholds; for that is what they will least expect, and they will \r\nhave the longer ride to catch you. Be off now as quick as you may!” \r\n\r\nThat is why they were now riding in silence, galloping wherever the ground was grassy and \r\nsmooth, with the mountains dark on their left, and in the distance the line of the river with its trees \r\ndrawing ever closer. The sun had only just turned west when they started, and till evening it lay golden \r\non the land about them. It was difficult to think of pursuing goblins behind, and when they had put \r\nmany miles between them and Beorn’ s house they began to talk and to sing again and to forget the \r\ndark forest-path that lay in front. But in the evening when the dusk came on and the peaks of the \r\nmountains glowered against the sunset they made a camp and set a guard, and most of them slept \r\nuneasily with dreams in which there came the howl of hunting wolves and the cries of goblins. \r\n\r\nStill the next morning dawned bright and fair again. There was an autumn-like mist white upon the \r\nground and the air was chill, but soon the sun rose red in the East and the mists vanished, and while \r\nthe shadows were still long they were off again. So they rode now for two more days, and all the while \r\nthey saw nothing save grass and flowers and birds and scattered trees, and occasionally small herds of \r\nred deer browsing or sitting at noon in the shade. Sometimes Bilbo saw the horns of the harts sticking \r\nup out of the long grass, and at first he thought they were the dead branches of trees. That third \r\nevening they were so eager to press on, for Beorn had said that they should reach the forest-gate early \r\non the fourth-day, that they rode still forward after dusk and into the night beneath the moon. As the \r\nlight faded Bilbo thought he saw away to the right, or to the left, the shadowy form of a great bear \r\nprowling along in the same direction. But if he dared to mention it to Gandalf, the wizard only said: \r\n“Hush! Take no notice!” \r\n\r\nNext day they started before dawn, though their night had been short. As soon as it was light they \r\ncould see the forest coming as it were to meet them, or waiting for them like a black and frowning \r\nwall before them. The land began to slope up and up, and it seemed to the hobbit that a silence began \r\nto draw in upon them. Birds began to sing less. There were no more deer; not even rabbits were to be \r\nseen. By the afternoon they had reached the eaves of Mirkwood, and were resting almost beneath the \r\ngreat overhanging boughs of its outer trees. Their trunks were huge and gnarled, their branches \r\ntwisted, their leaves were dark and long. Ivy grew on them and trailed along the ground. \r\n\r\n“Well, here is Mirkwood!” said Gandalf. “The greatest of the forests of the Northern world. I hope \r\nyou like the look of it. Now you must send back these excellent ponies you have borrowed.” \r\n\r\nThe dwarves were inclined to grumble at this, but the wizard told them they were fools. “Beorn is \r\nnot as far off as you seem to think, and you had better keep your promises anyway, for he is a bad \r\nenemy. Mr. Baggins’ eyes are sharper than yours, if you have not seen each night after dark a great \r\nbear going along with us or sitting far off in the moon watching our camps. Not only to guard you and \r\nguide you, but to keep an eye on the ponies too. Beorn may be your friend, but he loves his animals as \r\nhis children. You do not guess what kindness he has shown you in letting dwarves ride them so far and \r\nso fast, nor what would happen to you, if you tried to take them into the forest.” \r\n\r\n“What about the horse, then?” said Thorin. “You don’t mention sending that back.” \r\n\r\n“I don’t, because I am not sending it.” \r\n\r\n“What about your promise then?” \r\n\r\n“I will look after that. I am not sending the horse back, I am riding it!” \r\n\r\nThen they knew that Gandalf was going to leave them at the very edge of Mirkwood, and they were \r\nin despair. But nothing they could say would change his mind. \r\n\r\n“Now we had this all out before, when we landed on the Carrock,” he said. “It is no use arguing. I \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave, as I told you, some pressing business away south; and I am already late through bothering with \r\nyou people. We may meet again before all is over, and then again of course we may not. That depends \r\non your luck and on your courage and sense; and I am sending Mr. Baggins with you. I have told you \r\nbefore that he has more about him than you guess, and you will find that out before long. So cheer up \r\nBilbo and don’t look so glum. Cheer up Thorin and Company! This is your expedition after all. Think \r\nof the treasure at the end, and forget the forest and the dragon, at any rate until tomorrow morning!” \r\n\r\nWhen tomorrow morning came he still said the same. So now there was nothing left to do but to \r\nfill their water-skins at a clear spring they found close to the forest-gate, and unpack the ponies. They \r\ndistributed the packages as fairly as they could, though Bilbo thought his lot was wearisomely heavy, \r\nand did not at all like the idea of trudging for miles and miles with all that on his back. \r\n\r\n“Don’t you worry!” said Thorin. “It will get lighter all too soon. Before long I expect we shall all \r\nwish our packs heavier, when the food begins to run short.” \r\n\r\nThen at last they said good-bye to their ponies and turned their heads for home. Off they trotted \r\ngaily, seeming very glad to put their tails towards the shadow of Mirkwood. As they went away Bilbo \r\ncould have sworn that a thing like a bear left the shadow of the trees and shambled off quickly after \r\nthem. \r\n\r\nNow Gandalf too said farewell. Bilbo sat on the ground feeling very unhappy and wishing he was \r\nbeside the wizard on his tall horse. He had gone just inside the forest after breakfast (a very poor one), \r\nand it had seemed as dark in there in the morning as at night, and very secret: “a sort of watching and \r\nwaiting feeling,” he said to himself. \r\n\r\n“Good-bye!” said Gandalf to Thorin. “And goodbye to you all, good-bye! Straight through the \r\nforest is your way now. Don’t stray off the track! — if you do, it is a thousand to one you will never \r\nfind it again and never get out of Mirkwood; and then I don’t suppose I, or any one else, will ever see \r\nyou again.” \r\n\r\n“Do we really have to go through?” groaned the hobbit. \r\n\r\n“Yes, you do!” said the wizard, “if you want to get to the other side. You must either go through or \r\ngive up your quest. And I am not going to allow you to back out now, Mr. Baggins. I am ashamed of \r\nyou for thinking of it. You have got to look after all these dwarves for me,” he laughed. \r\n\r\n“No! no!” said Bilbo. “I didn’t mean that. I meant, is there no way round?” \r\n\r\n“There is, if you care to go two hundred miles or so out of your way north, and twice that south. \r\n\r\nBut you wouldn’t get a safe path even then. There are no safe paths in this part of the world. \r\nRemember you are over the Edge of the Wild now, and in for all sorts of fun wherever you go. Before \r\nyou could get round Mirkwood in the North you would be right among the slopes of the Grey \r\nMountains, and they are simply stiff with goblins, hobgoblins, and ores of the worst description. \r\nBefore you could get round it in the South, you would get into the land of the Necromancer; and even \r\nyou, Bilbo, won’t need me to tell you tales of that black sorcerer. I don’t advise you to go anywhere \r\nnear the places overlooked by his dark tower! Stick to the forest-track, keep your spirits up, hope for \r\nthe best, and with a tremendous slice of luck you may come out one day and see the Long \r\n\r\nMarshes lying below you, and beyond them, high in the East, the Lonely Mountain where dear old \r\nSmaug lives, though I hope he is not expecting you.” \r\n\r\n“Very comforting you are to be sure,” growled Thorin. “Good-bye! If you won’t come with us, you \r\nhad better get off without any more talk!” \r\n\r\n“Good-bye then, and really good-bye!” said Gandalf, and he turned his horse and rode down into \r\nthe West. But he could not resist the temptation to have the last word. Before he had passed quite out \r\nof hearing he turned and put his hands to his mouth and called to them. They heard his voice come \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfaintly: “Good-bye! Be good, take care of yourselves — and DON’T LEAVE THE PATH!” \r\n\r\nThen he galloped away and was soon lost to sight. “O good-bye and go away!” grunted the \r\ndwarves, all the more angry because they were really filled with dismay at losing him. Now began the \r\nmost dangerous part of all the journey. They each shouldered the heavy pack and the water-skin which \r\nwas their share, and turned from the light that lay on the lands outside and plunged into the forest."

    "ChapterData": "They walked in single file. The entrance to the path was like a sort of arch leading into a gloomy \r\ntunnel made by two great trees that leant together, too old and strangled with ivy and hung with lichen \r\nto bear more than a few blackened leaves. The path itself was narrow and wound in and out among the \r\ntrunks. Soon the light at the gate was like a little bright hole far behind, and the quiet was so deep that \r\ntheir feet seemed to thump along while all the trees leaned over them and listened. \r\n\r\nAs their eyes became used to the dimness they could see a little way to either side in a sort of \r\ndarkened green glimmer. Occasionally a slender beam of sun that had the luck to slip in through some \r\nopening in the leaves far above, and still more luck in not being caught in the tangled boughs and \r\nmatted twigs beneath, stabbed down thin and bright before them. But this was seldom, and it soon \r\nceased altogether. \r\n\r\nThere were black squirrels in the wood. As Bilbo’s sharp inquisitive eyes got used to seeing things \r\nhe could catch glimpses of them whisking off the path and scuttling behind tree-trunks. There were \r\nqueer noises too, grunts, scufflings, and hurryings in the undergrowth, and among the leaves that lay \r\npiled endlessly thick in places on the forest-floor; but what made the noises he could not see. The \r\nnastiest things they saw were the cobwebs: dark dense cobwebs with threads extraordinarily thick, \r\noften stretched from tree to tree, or tangled in the lower branches on either side of them. There were \r\nnone stretched across the path, but whether because some magic kept it clear, or for what other reason \r\nthey could not guess. \r\n\r\nIt was not long before they grew to hate the forest as heartily as they had hated the tunnels of the \r\ngoblins, and it seemed to offer even less hope of any ending. But they had to go on and on, long after \r\nthey were sick for a sight of the sun and of the sky, and longed for the feel of wind on their faces. \r\nThere was no movement of air down under the forest-roof, and it was everlastingly still and dark and \r\nstuffy. Even the dwarves felt it, who were used to tunnelling, and lived at times for long whiles \r\nwithout the light of the sun; but the hobbit, who liked holes to make a house in but not to spend \r\nsummer days in, felt that he was being slowly suffocated. \r\n\r\nThe nights were the worst. It then became pitch-dark — not what you call pitch-dark, but really \r\npitch: so black that you really could see nothing. Bilbo tried flapping his hand in front of his nose, but \r\nhe could not see it at all. Well, perhaps it is not true to say that they could see nothing: they could see \r\neyes. They slept all closely huddled together, and took it in turns to watch; and when it was Bilbo’s \r\nturn he would see gleams in the darkness round them, and sometimes pairs of yellow or red or green \r\neyes would stare at him from a little distance, and then slowly fade and disappear and slowly shine out \r\nagain in another place. And sometimes they would gleam down from the branches just above him; and \r\nthat was most terrifying. But the eyes that he liked the least were horrible pale bulbous sort of eyes. \r\n“Insect eyes,” he thought, “not animal eyes, only they are much too big.” \r\n\r\nAlthough it was not yet very cold, they tried lighting watch-fires at night, but they soon gave that \r\nup. It seemed to bring hundreds and hundreds of eyes all round them, though the creatures, whatever \r\nthey were, were careful never to let their bodies show in the little flicker of the flames. Worse still it \r\n\r\n\r\nbrought thousands of dark-grey and black moths, some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and \r\nwhirring round their ears. They could not stand that, nor the huge bats, black as a top-hat, either; so \r\nthey gave up fires and sat at night and dozed in the enormous uncanny darkness. \r\n\r\nAll this went on for what seemed to the hobbit ages upon ages; and he was always hungry, for they \r\nwere extremely careful with their provisions. Even so, as days followed days, and still the forest \r\nseemed just the same, they began to get anxious. The food would not last for ever: it was in fact \r\nalready beginning to get low. They tried shooting at the squirrels, and they wasted many arrows before \r\nthey managed to bring one down on the path. But when they roasted it, it proved horrible to taste, and \r\nthey shot no more squirrels. \r\n\r\nThey were thirsty too, for they had none too much water, and in all the time they had seen neither \r\nspring nor stream. This was their state when one day they found their path blocked by a running water. \r\nIt flowed fast and strong but not very wide right across the way, and it was black, or looked it in the \r\ngloom. It was well that Beorn had warned them against it, or they would have drunk from it, whatever \r\nits colour, and filled some of their emptied skins at its bank. As it was they only thought of how to \r\ncross it without wetting themselves in its water. There had been a bridge of wood across, but it had \r\nrotted and fallen leaving only the broken posts near the bank. \r\n\r\nBilbo kneeling on the brink and peering forward cried: “There is a boat against the far bank! Now \r\nwhy couldn’t it have been this side!” \r\n\r\n“How far away do you think it is?” asked Thorin, for by now they knew Bilbo had the sharpest eyes \r\namong them. \r\n\r\n“Not at all far. I shouldn’t think above twelve yards.” \r\n\r\n“Twelve yards! I should have thought it was thirty at least, but my eyes don’t see as well as they \r\nused a hundred years ago. Still twelve yards is as good as a mile. We can’t jump it, and we daren’t try \r\nto wade or swim.” \r\n\r\n“Can any of you throw a rope?” \r\n\r\n“What’s the good of that? The boat is sure to be tied up, even if we could hook it, which I doubt.” \r\n\r\n“I don’t believe it is tied,” said Bilbo, “though of course I can’t be sure in this light; but it looks to \r\nme as if it was just drawn up on the bank, which is low just there where the path goes down into the \r\nwater.” \r\n\r\n“Dori is the strongest, but Fili is the youngest and still has the best sight,” said Thorin. “Come here \r\nFili, and see if you can see the boat Mr. Baggins is talking about.” \r\n\r\nFili thought he could; so when he had stared a long while to get an idea of the direction, the others \r\nbrought him a rope. They had several with them, and on the end of the longest they fastened one of the \r\nlarge iron hooks they had used for catching their packs to the straps about their shoulders. Fili took \r\nthis in his hand, balanced it for a moment, and then flung it across the stream. \r\n\r\nSplash it fell in the water! “Not far enough!” said Bilbo who was peering forward. “A couple of \r\nfeet and you would have dropped it on to the boat. Try again. I don’t suppose the magic is strong \r\nenough to hurt you, if you just touch a bit of wet rope.” \r\n\r\nFili picked up the hook when he had drawn it back, rather doubtfully all the same. This time he \r\nthrew it with great strength. \r\n\r\n“Steady!” said Bilbo, “you have thrown it right into the wood on the other side now. Draw it back \r\ngently.” Fili hauled the rope back slowly, and after a while Bilbo said: “Carefully! It is lying on the \r\nboat; let’s hope the hook will catch.” \r\n\r\nIt did. The rope went taut, and Fili pulled in vain. Kili came to his help, and then Oin and Gloin. \r\nThey tugged and tugged, and suddenly they all fell over on their backs. Bilbo was on the look out, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhowever, caught the rope, and with a piece of stick fended off the little black boat as it came rushing \r\nacross the stream. “Help!” he shouted, and Balin was just in time to seize the boat before it floated off \r\ndown the current. \r\n\r\n“It was tied after all,” said he, looking at the snapped painter that was still dangling from it. “That \r\nwas a good pull, my lads; and a good job that our rope was the stronger.” \r\n\r\n“Who’ll cross first?” asked Bilbo. \r\n\r\n“I shall,” said Thorin, “and you will come with me, and Fili and Balin. That’s as many as the boat \r\nwill hold at a time. After that Kili and Oin and Gloin and Dori; next Ori and Nori, Bifur and Bofur; \r\nand last Dwalin and Bombur.” \r\n\r\n“I’m always last and I don’t like it,” said Bombur. “It’s somebody else’s turn today.” \r\n\r\n“You should not be so fat. As you are, you must be with the last and lightest boatload. Don’t start \r\ngrumbling against orders, or something bad will happen to you.” \r\n\r\n“There aren’t any oars. How are you going to push the boat back to the far bank?” asked the hobbit. \r\n\r\n“Give me another length of rope and another hook,” said Fili, and when they had got it ready, he \r\ncast it into the darkness ahead and as high as he could throw it. Since it did not fall down again, they \r\nsaw that it must have stuck in the branches. “Get in now,” said Fili, “and one of you haul on the rope \r\nthat is stuck in a tree on the other side. One of the others must keep hold of the hook we used at first, \r\nand when we are safe on the other side he can hook it on, and you can draw the boat back.” \r\n\r\nIn this way they were all soon on the far bank safe across the enchanted stream. Dwalin had just \r\nscrambled out with the coiled rope on his arm, and Bombur (still grumbling) was getting ready to \r\nfollow, when something bad did happen. There was a flying sound of hooves on the path ahead. Out of \r\nthe gloom came suddenly the shape of a flying deer. It charged into the dwarves and bowled them \r\nover, then gathered itself for a leap. High it sprang and cleared the water with a mighty jump. But it \r\ndid not reach the other side in safety. Thorin was the only one who had kept his feet and his wits. As \r\nsoon as they had landed he had bent his bow and fitted an arrow in case any hidden guardian of the \r\nboat appeared. Now he sent a swift and sure shot into the leaping beast. As it reached the further bank \r\nit stumbled. The shadows swallowed it up, but they heard the sound of hooves quickly falter and then \r\ngo still. \r\n\r\nBefore they could shout in praise of the shot, however, a dreadful wail from Bilbo put all thoughts \r\nof venison out of their minds. “Bombur has fallen in! Bombur is drowning!” he cried. It was only too \r\ntrue. Bombur had only one foot on the land when the hart bore down on him, and sprang over him. He \r\nhad stumbled, thrusting the boat away from the bank, and then toppled back into the dark water, his \r\nhands slipping off the slimy roots at the edge, while the boat span slowly off and disappeared. \r\n\r\nThey could still see his hood above the water when they ran to the bank. Quickly, they flung a rope \r\nwith a hook towards him. His hand caught it, and they pulled him to the shore. He was drenched from \r\nhair to boots, of course, but that was not the worst. When they laid him on the bank he was already fast \r\nasleep, with one hand clutching the rope so tight that they could not get it from his grasp; and fast \r\nasleep he remained in spite of all they could do. \r\n\r\nThey were still standing over him, cursing their ill luck, and Bombur’ s clumsiness, and lamenting \r\nthe loss of the boat which made it impossible for them to go back and look for the hart, when they \r\nbecame aware of the dim blowing of horns in the wood and the sound as of dogs baying far off. Then \r\nthey all fell silent; and as they sat it seemed they could hear the noise of a great hunt going by to the \r\nnorth of the path, though they saw no sign of it. \r\n\r\nThere they sat for a long while and did not dare to make a move. Bombur slept on with a smile on \r\nhis fat face, as if he no longer cared for all the troubles that vexed them. Suddenly on the path ahead \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappeared some white deer, a hind and fawns as snowy white as the hart had been dark. They \r\nglimmered in the shadows. Before Thorin could cry out three of the dwarves had leaped to their feet \r\nand loosed off arrows from their bows. None seemed to find their mark. The deer turned and vanished \r\nin the trees as silently as they had come, and in vain the dwarves shot their arrows after them. \r\n\r\n“Stop! stop!” shouted Thorin; but it was too late, the excited dwarves had wasted their last arrows, \r\nand now the bows that Beorn had given them were useless. \r\n\r\nThey were a gloomy party that night, and the gloom gathered still deeper on them in the following \r\ndays. They had crossed the enchanted stream; but beyond it the path seemed to straggle on just as \r\nbefore, and in the forest they could see no change. Yet if they had known more about it and considered \r\nthe meaning of the hunt and the white deer that had appeared upon their path, they would have known \r\nthat they were at last drawing towards the eastern edge, and would soon have come, if they could have \r\nkept up their courage and their hope, to thinner trees and places where the sunlight came again. \r\n\r\nBut they did not know this, and they were burdened with the heavy body of Bombur, which they \r\nhad to carry along with them as best they could, taking the wearisome task in turns of four each while \r\nthe others shared their packs. If these had not become all too light in the last few days, they would \r\nnever have managed it; but a slumbering and smiling Bombur was a poor exchange for packs filled \r\nwith food however heavy. In a few days a time came when there was practically nothing left to eat or \r\nto drink. Nothing wholesome could they see growing in the wood, only funguses and herbs with pale \r\nleaves and unpleasant smell. \r\n\r\nAbout four days from the enchanted stream they came to a part where most of the trees were \r\nbeeches. They were at first inclined to be cheered by the change, for here there was no undergrowth \r\nand the shadow was not so deep. There was a greenish light about them, and in places they could see \r\nsome distance to either side of the path. Yet the light only showed them endless lines of straight grey \r\ntrunks like the pillars of some huge twilight hall. There was a breath of air and a noise of wind, but it \r\nhad a sad sound. A few leaves came rustling down to remind them that outside autumn was coming on. \r\nTheir feet ruffled among the dead leaves of countless other autumns that drifted over the banks of the \r\npath from the deep red carpets of the forest. \r\n\r\nStill Bombur slept and they grew very weary. At times they heard disquieting laughter. Sometimes \r\nthere was singing in the distance too. The laughter was the laughter of fair voices not of goblins, and \r\nthe singing was beautiful, but it sounded eerie and strange, and they were not comforted, rather they \r\nhurried on from those parts with what strength they had left. \r\n\r\nTwo days later they found their path going downwards, and before long they were in a valley filled \r\nalmost entirely with a mighty growth of oaks. \r\n\r\n“Is there no end to this accursed forest?” said Thorin. “Somebody must climb a tree and see if he \r\ncan get his head above the roof and have a look round. The only way is to choose the tallest tree that \r\noverhangs the path.” \r\n\r\nOf course “somebody” meant Bilbo. They chose him, because to be of any use the climber must get \r\nhis head above the topmost leaves, and so he must be light enough for the highest and slenderest \r\nbranches to bear him. Poor Mr. Baggins had never had much practice in climbing trees, but they \r\nhoisted him up into the lowest branches of an enormous oak that grew right out into the path, and up \r\nhe had to go as best he could. He pushed his way through the tangled twigs with many a slap in the \r\neye; he was greened and grimed from the old bark of the greater boughs; more than once he slipped \r\nand caught himself just in time; and at last, after a dreadful struggle in a difficult place where there \r\nseemed to be no convenient branches at all, he got near the top. All the time he was wondering \r\nwhether there were spiders in the tree, and how he was going to get down again (except by falling). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the end he poked his head above the roof of leaves, and then he found spiders all right. But they \r\nwere only small ones of ordinary size, and they were after the butterflies. Bilbo’s eyes were nearly \r\nblinded by the light. He could hear the dwarves shouting up at him from far below, but he could not \r\nanswer, only hold on and blink. The sun was shining brilliantly, and it was a long while before he \r\ncould bear it. When he could, he saw all round him a sea of dark green, ruffled here and there by the \r\nbreeze; and there were everywhere hundreds of butterflies. I expect they were a kind of “purple \r\nemperor”, a butterfly that loves the tops of oak-woods, but these were not purple at all, they were a \r\ndark dark velvety black without any markings to be seen. \r\n\r\nHe looked at the “black emperors” for a long time, and enjoyed the feel of the breeze in his hair \r\nand on his face; but at length the cries of the dwarves, who were now simply stamping with \r\nimpatience down below, reminded him of his real business. It was no good. Gaze as much as he might, \r\nhe could see no end to the trees and the leaves in any direction. His heart, that had been lightened by \r\nthe sight of the sun and the feel of the wind, sank back into his toes: there was no food to go back to \r\ndown below. \r\n\r\nActually, as I have told you, they were not far off the edge of the forest; and if Bilbo had had the \r\nsense to see it, the tree that he had climbed, though it was tall in itself, was standing near the bottom \r\nof a wide valley, so that from its top the trees seemed to swell up all round like the edges of a great \r\nbowl, and he could not expect to see how far the forest lasted. Still he did not see this, and he climbed \r\ndown full of despair. He got to the bottom again at last, scratched, hot, and miserable, and he could not \r\nsee anything in the gloom below when he got there. His report soon made the others as miserable as he \r\nwas. \r\n\r\n“The forest goes on for ever and ever and ever in all directions! Whatever shall we do? And what is \r\nthe use of sending a hobbit!” they cried, as if it was his fault. They did not care tuppence about the \r\nbutterflies, and were only made more angry when he told them of the beautiful breeze, which they \r\nwere too heavy to climb up and feel. \r\n\r\n\r\nThat night they ate their very last scraps and crumbs of food; and next morning when they woke the \r\nfirst thing they noticed was that they were still gnawingly hungry, and the next thing was that it was \r\nraining and that here and there the drip of it was dropping heavily on the forest floor. That only \r\nreminded them that they were also parchingly thirsty, without doing anything to relieve them: you \r\ncannot quench a terrible thirst by standing under giant oaks and waiting for a chance drip to fall on \r\nyour tongue. The only scrap of comfort there was came unexpectedly from Bombur. \r\n\r\nHe woke up suddenly and sat up scratching his head. He could not make out where he was at all, \r\nnor why he felt so hungry; for he had forgotten everything that had happened since they started their \r\njourney that May morning long ago. The last thing that he remembered was the party at the hobbit’s \r\nhouse, and they had great difficulty in making him believe their tale of all the many adventures they \r\nhad had since. \r\n\r\nWhen he heard that there was nothing to eat, he sat down and wept, for he felt very weak and \r\nwobbly in the legs. “Why ever did I wake up!” he cried. “I was having such beautiful dreams. I \r\ndreamed I was walking in a forest rather like this one, only lit with torches on the trees and lamps \r\nswinging from the branches and fires burning on the ground; and there was a great feast going on, \r\ngoing on for ever. A woodland king was there with a crown of leaves, and there was a merry singing, \r\nand I could not count or describe the things there were to eat and drink.” \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You need not try,” said Thorin. “In fact if you can’t talk about something else, you had better be \r\nsilent. We are quite annoyed enough with you as it is. If you hadn’t waked up, we should have left you \r\nto your idiotic dreams in the forest; you are no joke to carry even after weeks of short commons.” \r\n\r\nThere was nothing now to be done but to tighten the belts round their empty stomachs, and hoist \r\ntheir empty sacks and packs, and trudge along the track without any great hope of ever getting to the \r\nend before they lay down and died of starvation. This they did all that day, going very slowly and \r\nwearily; while Bombur kept on wailing that his legs would not carry him and that he wanted to lie \r\ndown and sleep. \r\n\r\n“No you don’t!” they said. “Let your legs take their share, we have carried you far enough.” \r\n\r\nAll the same he suddenly refused to go a step further and flung himself on the ground. “Go on, if \r\nyou must,” he said. “I’m just going to lie here and sleep and dream of food, if I can’t get it any other \r\nway. I hope I never wake up again.” \r\n\r\nAt that very moment Balin, who was a little way ahead, called out: “What was that? I thought I saw \r\na twinkle of light in the forest.” \r\n\r\nThey all looked, and a longish way off, it seemed, they saw a red twinkle in the dark; then another \r\nand another sprang out beside it. Even Bombur got up, and they hurried along then, not caring if it was \r\ntrolls or goblins. The light was in front of them and to the left of the path, and when at last they had \r\ndrawn level with it, it seemed plain that torches and fires were burning under the trees, but a good way \r\noff their track. \r\n\r\n“It looks as if my dreams were coming true,” gasped Bombur puffing up behind. He wanted to rush \r\nstraight off into the wood after the lights. But the others remembered only too well the warnings of the \r\nwizard and of Beorn. \r\n\r\n“A feast would be no good, if we never got back alive from it,” said Thorin. \r\n\r\n“But without a feast we shan’t remain alive much longer anyway,” said Bombur, and Bilbo heartily \r\nagreed with him. They argued about it backwards and forwards for a long while, until they agreed at \r\nlength to send out a couple of spies, to creep near the lights and find out more about them. But then \r\nthey could not agree on who was to be sent: no one seemed anxious to run the chance of being lost and \r\nnever finding his friends again. In the end, in spite of warnings, hunger decided them, because Bombur \r\nkept on describing all the good things that were being eaten, according to his dream, in the woodland \r\nfeast; so they all left the path and plunged into the forest together. \r\n\r\nAfter a good deal of creeping and crawling they peered round the trunks and looked into a clearing \r\nwhere some trees had been felled and the ground levelled. There were many people there, elvish- \r\nlooking folk, all dressed in green and brown and sitting on sawn rings of the felled trees in a great \r\ncircle. There was a fire in their midst and there were torches fastened to some of the trees round about; \r\nbut most splendid sight of all: they were eating and drinking and laughing merrily. \r\n\r\nThe smell of the roast meats was so enchanting that, without waiting to consult one another, every \r\none of them got up and scrambled forwards into the ring with the one idea of begging for some food. \r\nNo sooner had the first stepped into the clearing than all the lights went out as if by magic. Somebody \r\nkicked the fire and it went up in rockets of glittering sparks and vanished. They were lost in a \r\ncompletely lightless dark and they could not even find one another, not for a long time at any rate. \r\nAfter blundering frantically in the gloom, falling over logs, bumping crash into trees, and shouting \r\nand calling till they must have waked everything in the forest for miles, at last they managed to gather \r\nthemselves in a bundle and count themselves by touch. By that time they had, of course, quite \r\nforgotten in what direction the path lay, and they were all hopelessly lost, at least till morning. \r\n\r\nThere was nothing for it but to settle down for the night where they were; they did not even dare to \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsearch on the ground for scraps of food for fear of becoming separated again. But they had not been \r\nlying long, and Bilbo was only just getting drowsy, when Dori, whose turn it was to watch first, said in \r\na loud whisper: \r\n\r\n“The lights are coming out again over there, and there are more than ever of them.” \r\n\r\nUp they all jumped. There, sure enough, not far away were scores of twinkling lights, and they \r\nheard the voices and the laughter quite plainly. They crept slowly towards them, in a single line, each \r\ntouching the back of the one in front. When they got near Thorin said: “No rushing forward this time! \r\nNo one is to stir from hiding till I say. I shall send Mr. Baggins alone first to talk to them. They won’t \r\nbe frightened of him — (‘What about me of them?’ thought Bilbo) — and any way I hope they won’t do \r\nanything nasty to him.” \r\n\r\nWhen they got to the edge of the circle of lights they pushed Bilbo suddenly from behind. Before \r\nhe had time to slip on his ring, he stumbled forward into the full blaze of the fire and torches. It was \r\nno good. Out went all the lights again and complete darkness fell. \r\n\r\nIf it had been difficult collecting themselves before, it was far worse this time. And they simply \r\ncould not find the hobbit. Every time they counted themselves it only made thirteen. They shouted and \r\ncalled: “Bilbo Baggins! Hobbit! You dratted hobbit! Hi! hobbit, confusticate you, where are you?” and \r\nother things of that sort, but there was no answer. \r\n\r\nThey were just giving up hope, when Dori stumbled across him by sheer luck. In the dark he fell \r\nover what he thought was a log, and he found it was the hobbit curled up fast asleep. It took a deal of \r\nshaking to wake him, and when he was awake he was not pleased at all. \r\n\r\n“I was having such a lovely dream,” he grumbled, “all about having a most gorgeous dinner.” \r\n\r\n“Good heavens! he has gone like Bombur,” they said. “Don’t tell us about dreams. Dream-dinners \r\naren’t any good, and we can’t share them.” \r\n\r\n“They are the best I am likely to get in this beastly place,” he muttered, as he lay down beside the \r\ndwarves and tried to go back to sleep and find his dream again. But that was not the last of the lights \r\nin the forest. Later when the night must have been getting old, Kili who was watching then, came and \r\nroused them all again, saying: \r\n\r\n“There’s a regular blaze of light begun not far away — hundreds of torches and many fires must \r\nhave been lit suddenly and by magic. And hark to the singing and the harps!” \r\n\r\nAfter lying and listening for a while, they found they could not resist the desire to go nearer and try \r\nonce more to get help. Up they got again; and this time the result was disastrous. The feast that they \r\nnow saw was greater and more magnificent than before; and at the head of a long line of feasters sat a \r\nwoodland king with a crown of leaves upon his golden hair, very much as Bombur had described the \r\nfigure in his dream. The elvish folk were passing bowls from hand to hand and across the fires, and \r\nsome were harping and many were singing. Their gleaming hair was twined with flowers; green and \r\nwhite gems glinted on their collars and their belts; and their faces and their songs were filled with \r\nmirth. Loud and clear and fair were those songs, and out stepped Thorin in to their midst. \r\n\r\nDead silence fell in the middle of a word. Out went all light. The fires leaped up in black smokes. \r\nAshes and cinders were in the eyes of the dwarves, and the wood was filled again with their clamour \r\nand their cries. \r\n\r\nBilbo found himself running round and round (as he thought) and calling and calling: “Dori, Nori, \r\nOri, Oin, Gloin, Lili, Kili, Bombur, Bifur, Bofur, Dwalin, Balin, Thorin Oakenshield,” while people he \r\ncould not see or feel were doing the same all round him (with an occasional “Bilbo!” thrown in). But \r\nthe cries of the others got steadily further and fainter, and though after a while it seemed to him they \r\nchanged to yells and cries for help in the far distance, all noise at last died right away, and he was left \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalone in complete silence and darkness. \r\n\r\n\r\nThat was one of his most miserable moments. But he soon made up his mind that it was no good \r\ntrying to do anything till day came with some little light, and quite useless to go blundering about \r\ntiring himself out with no hope of any breakfast to revive him. So he sat himself down with his back to \r\na tree, and not for the last time fell to thinking of his far-distant hobbit-hole with its beautiful pantries. \r\nHe was deep in thoughts of bacon and eggs and toast and butter when he felt something touch him. \r\nSomething like a strong sticky string was against his left hand, and when he tried to move he found \r\nthat his legs were already wrapped in the same stuff, so that when he got up he fell over. \r\n\r\nThen the great spider, who had been busy tying him up while he dozed, came from behind him and \r\ncame at him. He could only see the thing’s eyes, but he could feel its hairy legs as it struggled to wind \r\nits abominable threads round and round him. It was lucky that he had come to his senses in time. Soon \r\nhe would not have been able to move at all. As it was, he had a desperate fight before he got free. He \r\nbeat the creature off with his hands — it was trying to poison him to keep him quiet, as small spiders \r\ndo to flies — until he remembered his sword and drew it out. Then the spider jumped back, and he had \r\ntime to cut his legs loose. After that it was his turn to attack. The spider evidently was not used to \r\nthings that carried such stings at their sides, or it would have hurried away quicker. Bilbo came at it \r\nbefore it could disappear and stuck it with his sword right in the eyes. Then it went mad and leaped \r\nand danced and flung out its legs in horrible jerks, until he killed it with another stroke; and then he \r\nfell down and remembered nothing more for a long while. \r\n\r\nThere was the usual dim grey light of the forest-day about him when he came to his senses. The \r\nspider lay dead beside him, and his sword-blade was stained black. Somehow the killing of the giant \r\nspider, all alone by himself in the dark without the help of the wizard or the dwarves or of anyone else, \r\nmade a great difference to Mr. Baggins. He felt a different person, and much fiercer and bolder in \r\nspite of an empty stomach, as he wiped his sword on the grass and put it back into its sheath. \r\n\r\n“I will give you a name,” he said to it, “and I shall call you Sting.” \r\n\r\nAfter that he set out to explore. The forest was grim and silent, but obviously he had first of all to \r\nlook for his friends, who were not likely to be very far off, unless they had been made prisoners by the \r\nelves (or worse things). Bilbo felt that it was unsafe to shout, and he stood a long while wondering in \r\nwhat direction the path lay, and in what direction he should go first to look for the dwarves. \r\n\r\n“O! why did we not remember Beorn’s advice, and Gandalf’s!” he lamented. “What a mess we are \r\nin now! We! I only wish it was we: it is horrible being all alone.” \r\n\r\nIn the end he made as good a guess as he could at the direction from which the cries for help had \r\ncome in the night — and by luck (he was born with a good share of it) he guessed more or less right, as \r\nyou will see. Having made up his mind he crept along as cleverly as he could. Hobbits are clever at \r\nquietness, especially in woods, as I have already told you; also Bilbo had slipped on his ring before he \r\nstarted. That is why the spiders neither saw nor heard him coming. \r\n\r\nHe had picked his way stealthily for some distance, when he noticed a place of dense black shadow \r\nahead of him, black even for that forest, like a patch of midnight that had never been cleared away. As \r\nhe drew nearer, he saw that it was made by spider-webs one behind and over and tangled with another. \r\nSuddenly he saw, too, that there were spiders huge and horrible sitting in the branches above him, and \r\nring or no ring he trembled with fear lest they should discover him. Standing behind a tree he watched \r\na group of them for some time, and then in the silence and stillness of the wood he realised that these \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nloathsome creatures were speaking one to another. Their voices were a sort of thin creaking and \r\nhissing, but he could make out many of the words that they said. They were talking about the dwarves! \r\n\r\n“It was a sharp struggle, but worth it,” said one. “What nasty thick skins they have to be sure, but \r\nI’ll wager there is good juice inside.” \r\n\r\n“Aye, they’ll make fine eating, when they’ve hung a bit,” said another. \r\n\r\n“Don’t hang ’em too long,” said a third. “They’re not as fat as they might be. Been feeding none \r\ntoo well of late, I should guess.” \r\n\r\n“Kill ’em, I say,” hissed a fourth; “kill ’em now and hang ’em dead for a while.” \r\n\r\n“They’re dead now, I’ll warrant,” said the first. “That they are not. I saw one a-struggling just now. \r\nJust coming round again, I should say, after a bee-autiful sleep. I’ll show you.” \r\n\r\nWith that one of the fat spiders ran along a rope till it came to a dozen bundles hanging in a row \r\nfrom a high branch. Bilbo was horrified, now that he noticed them for the first time dangling in the \r\nshadows, to see a dwarvish foot sticking out of the bottoms of some of the bundles, or here and there \r\nthe tip of a nose, or a bit of beard or of a hood. \r\n\r\nTo the fattest of these bundles the spider went — “It is poor old Bombur, I’ll bet,” thought Bilbo — \r\nand nipped hard at the nose that stuck out. There was a muffled yelp inside, and a toe shot up and \r\nkicked the spider straight and hard. There was life in Bombur still. There was a noise like the kicking \r\nof a flabby football, and the enraged spider fell off the branch, only catching itself with its own thread \r\njust in time. \r\n\r\nThe others laughed. “You were quite right,” they said, “the meat’s alive and kicking!” \r\n\r\n“I’ll soon put an end to that,” hissed the angry spider climbing back onto the branch. \r\n\r\n\r\nBilbo saw that the moment had come when he must do something. He could not get up at the brutes \r\nand he had nothing to shoot with; but looking about he saw that in this place there were many stones \r\nlying in what appeared to be a now dry little watercourse. Bilbo was a pretty fair shot with a stone, and \r\nit did not take him long to find a nice smooth egg-shaped one that fitted his hand cosily. As a boy he \r\nused to practise throwing stones at things, until rabbits and squirrels, and even birds, got out of his \r\nway as quick as lightning if they saw him stoop; and even grownup he had still spent a deal of his time \r\nat quoits, dart-throwing, shooting at the wand, bowls, ninepins and other quiet games of the aiming \r\nand throwing sort — indeed he could do lots of things, besides blowing smoke-rings, asking riddles and \r\ncooking, that I haven’t had time to tell you about. There is no time now. While he was picking up \r\nstones, the spider had reached Bombur, and soon he would have been dead. At that moment Bilbo \r\nthrew. The stone struck the spider plunk on the head, and it dropped senseless off the tree, flop to the \r\nground, with all its legs curled up. \r\n\r\nThe next stone went whizzing through a big web, snapping its cords, and taking off the spider \r\nsitting in the middle of it, whack, dead. After that there was a deal of commotion in the spider-colony, \r\nand they forgot the dwarves for a bit, I can tell you. They could not see Bilbo, but they could make a \r\ngood guess at the direction from which the stones were coming. As quick as lightning they came \r\nrunning and swinging towards the hobbit, flinging out their long threads in all directions, till the air \r\nseemed full of waving snares. \r\n\r\nBilbo, however, soon slipped away to a different place. The idea came to him to lead the furious \r\nspiders further and further away from the dwarves, if he could; to make them curious, excited and \r\nangry all at once. When about fifty had gone off to the place where he had stood before, he threw some \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore stones at these, and at others that had stopped behind; then dancing among the trees he began to \r\nsing a song to infuriate them and bring them all after him, and also to let the dwarves hear his voice. \r\nThis is what he sang: \r\n\r\n\r\nOld fat spider spinning in a tree! \r\nOld fat spider can’t see me! \r\nAttercop! Attercop! \r\n\r\nWon’t you stop, \r\n\r\nStop your spinning and look for me? \r\n\r\n\r\nOld Tomnoddy, all big body, \r\n\r\nOld Tomnoddy can’t spy me! \r\nAttercop! Attercop! \r\n\r\nDown you drop! \r\n\r\nYou’ll never catch me up your tree! \r\n\r\n\r\nNot very good perhaps, but then you must remember that he had to make it up himself, on the spur \r\nof a very awkward moment. It did what he wanted any way. As he sang he threw some more stones \r\nand stamped. Practically all the spiders in the place came after him: some dropped to the ground, \r\nothers raced along the branches, swung from tree to tree, or cast new ropes across the dark spaces. \r\nThey made for his noise far quicker than he had expected. They were frightfully angry. Quite apart \r\nfrom the stones no spider has ever liked being called Attercop, and Tomnoddy of course is insulting to \r\nanybody. \r\n\r\nOff Bilbo scuttled to a fresh place, but several of the spiders had run now to different points in the \r\nglade where they lived, and were busy spinning webs across all the spaces between the tree-stems. \r\nVery soon the hobbit would be caught in a thick fence of them all round him — that at least was the \r\nspiders’ idea. Standing now in the middle of the hunting and spinning insects Bilbo plucked up his \r\ncourage and began a new song: \r\n\r\n\r\nLazy Lob and crazy Cob \r\nare weaving webs to wind me. \r\n\r\nI am far more sweet than other meat, \r\nbut still they cannot find me! \r\n\r\n\r\nHere am I, naughty little fly; \r\nyou are fat and lazy. \r\n\r\nYou cannot trap me, though you try, \r\nin your cobwebs crazy. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith that he turned and found that the last space between two tall trees had been closed with a web \r\n— but luckily not a proper web, only great strands of double-thick spider-rope run hastily backwards \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand forwards from trunk to trunk. Out came his little sword. He slashed the threads to pieces and went \r\noff singing. \r\n\r\nThe spiders saw the sword, though I don’t suppose they knew what it was, and at once the whole lot \r\nof them came hurrying after the hobbit along the ground and the branches, hairy legs waving, nippers \r\nand spinners snapping, eyes popping, full of froth and rage. They followed him into the forest until \r\nBilbo had gone as far as he dared. Then quieter than a mouse he stole back. \r\n\r\nHe had precious little time, he knew, before the spiders were disgusted and came back to their trees \r\nwhere the dwarves were hung. In the meanwhile he had to rescue them. The worst part of the job was \r\ngetting up on to the long branch where the bundles were dangling. I don’t suppose he would have \r\nmanaged it, if a spider had not luckily left a rope hanging down; with its help, though it stuck to his \r\nhand and hurt him, he scrambled up — only to meet an old slow wicked fat-bodied spider who had \r\nremained behind to guard the prisoners, and had been busy pinching them to see which was the juiciest \r\nto eat. It had thought of starting the feast while the others were away, but Mr. Baggins was in a hurry, \r\nand before the spider knew what was happening it felt his sting and rolled off the branch dead. \r\n\r\nBilbo’s next job was to loose a dwarf. What was he to do? If he cut the string which hung him up, \r\nthe wretched dwarf would tumble thump to the ground a good way below. Wriggling along the branch \r\n(which made all the poor dwarves dance and dangle like ripe fruit) he reached the first bundle. \r\n\r\n“Fili or Kili,” he thought by the tip of a blue hood sticking out at the top. “Most likely Fili,” he \r\nthought by the tip of a long nose poking out of the winding threads. He managed by leaning over to cut \r\nmost of the strong sticky threads that bound him round, and then, sure enough, with a kick and a \r\nstruggle most of Fili emerged. I am afraid Bilbo actually laughed at the sight of him jerking his stiff \r\narms and legs as he danced on the spider-string under his armpits, just like one of those funny toys \r\nbobbing on a wire. \r\n\r\nSomehow or other Fili was got on to the branch, and then he did his best to help the hobbit, \r\nalthough he was feeling very sick and ill from spider-poison, and from hanging most of the night and \r\nthe next day wound round and round with only his nose to breathe through. It took him ages to get the \r\nbeastly stuff out of his eyes and eyebrows, and as for his beard, he had to cut most of it off. Well, \r\nbetween them they started to haul up first one dwarf and then another and slash them free. None of \r\nthem were better off than Fili, and some of them were worse. Some had hardly been able to breathe at \r\nall (long noses are sometimes useful you see) and some had been more poisoned. \r\n\r\nIn this way they rescued Kili, Bifur, Bofur, Dori and Nori. Poor old Bombur was so exhausted — he \r\nwas the fattest and had been constantly pinched and poked — that he just rolled off the branch and fell \r\nplop on to the ground, fortunately on to leaves, and lay there. But there were still five dwarves hanging \r\nat the end of the branch when the spiders began to come back, more full of rage than ever. \r\n\r\nBilbo immediately went to the end of the branch nearest the tree-trunk and kept back those that \r\ncrawled up. He had taken off his ring when he rescued Fili and forgotten to put it on again, so now \r\nthey all began to splutter and hiss: \r\n\r\n“Now we see you, you nasty little creature! We will eat you and leave your bones and skin hanging \r\non a tree. Ugh! he’s got a sting has he? Well, we’ll get him all the same, and then we’ll hang him head \r\ndownwards for a day or two.” \r\n\r\nWhile this was going on, the other dwarves were working at the rest of the captives, and cutting at \r\nthe threads with their knives. Soon all would be free, though it was not clear what would happen after \r\nthat. The spiders had caught them pretty easily the night before, but that had been unawares and in the \r\ndark. This time there looked like being a horrible battle. \r\n\r\nSuddenly Bilbo noticed that some of the spiders had gathered round old Bombur on the floor, and \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad tied him up again and were dragging him away. He gave a shout and slashed at the spiders in front \r\nof him. They quickly gave way, and he scrambled and fell down the tree right into the middle of those \r\non the ground. His little sword was something new in the way of stings for them. How it darted to and \r\nfro! It shone with delight as he stabbed at them. Half a dozen were killed before the rest drew off and \r\nleft Bombur to Bilbo. \r\n\r\n“Come down! Come down!” he shouted to the dwarves on the branch. “Don’t stay up there and be \r\nnetted!” For he saw spiders swarming up all the neighbouring trees, and crawling along the boughs \r\nabove the heads of the dwarves. \r\n\r\nDown the dwarves scrambled or jumped or dropped, eleven all in a heap, most of them very shaky \r\nand little use on their legs. There they were at last, twelve of them counting poor old Bombur, who \r\nwas being propped up on either side by his cousin Bifur, and his brother Bofur; and Bilbo was dancing \r\nabout and waving his Sting; and hundreds of angry spiders were goggling at them all round and about \r\nand above. It looked pretty hopeless. \r\n\r\nThen the battle began. Some of the dwarves had knives, and some had sticks, and all of them could \r\nget at stones; and Bilbo had his elvish dagger. Again and again the spiders were beaten off, and many \r\nof them were killed. But it could not go on for long. Bilbo was nearly tired out; only four of the \r\ndwarves were able to stand firmly, and soon they would all be overpowered like weary flies. Already \r\nthe spiders were beginning to weave their webs all round them again from tree to tree. \r\n\r\nIn the end Bilbo could think of no plan except to let the dwarves into the secret of his ring. He was \r\nrather sorry about it, but it could not be helped. \r\n\r\n“I am going to disappear,” he said. “I shall draw the spiders off, if I can; and you must keep \r\ntogether and make in the opposite direction. To the left there, that is more or less the way towards the \r\nplace where we last saw the elf-fires.” \r\n\r\nIt was difficult to get them to understand, what with their dizzy heads, and the shouts, and the \r\nwhacking of sticks and the throwing of stones; but at last Bilbo felt he could delay no longer — the \r\nspiders were drawing their circle ever closer. He suddenly slipped on his ring, and to the great \r\nastonishment of the dwarves he vanished. \r\n\r\nSoon there came the sound of “Lazy Lob” and “Attercop” from among the trees away on the right. \r\nThat upset the spiders greatly. They stopped advancing, and some went off in the direction of the \r\nvoice. “Attercop” made them so angry that they lost their wits. Then Balin, who had grasped Bilbo’s \r\nplan better than the rest, led an attack. The dwarves huddled together in a knot, and sending a shower \r\nof stones they drove at the spiders on the left, and burst through the ring. Away behind them now the \r\nshouting and singing suddenly stopped. \r\n\r\nHoping desperately that Bilbo had not been caught the dwarves went on. Not fast enough, though. \r\nThey were sick and weary, and they could not go much better than a hobble and a wobble, though \r\nmany of the spiders were close behind. Every now and then they had to turn and fight the creatures \r\nthat were overtaking them; and already some spiders were in the trees above them and throwing down \r\ntheir long clinging threads. \r\n\r\nThings were looking pretty bad again, when suddenly Bilbo reappeared, and charged into the \r\nastonished spiders unexpectedly from the side. \r\n\r\n“Go on! Go on!” he shouted. “I will do the stinging!” \r\n\r\nAnd he did. He darted backwards and forwards, slashing at spider-threads, hacking at their legs, \r\nand stabbing at their fat bodies if they came too near. The spiders swelled with rage, and spluttered \r\nand frothed, and hissed out horrible curses; but they had become mortally afraid of Sting, and dared \r\nnot come very near, now that it had come back. So curse as they would, their prey moved slowly but \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsteadily away. It was a most terrible business, and seemed to take hours. But at last, just when Bilbo \r\nfelt that he could not lift his hand for a single stroke more, the spiders suddenly gave it up, and \r\nfollowed them no more, but went back disappointed to their dark colony. \r\n\r\nThe dwarves then noticed that they had come to the edge of a ring where elf-fires had been. \r\nWhether it was one of those they had seen the night before, they could not tell. But it seemed that \r\nsome good magic lingered in such spots, which the spiders did not like. At any rate here the light was \r\ngreener, and the boughs less thick and threatening, and they had a chance to rest and draw breath. \r\n\r\nThere they lay for some time, puffing and panting. But very soon they began to ask questions. They \r\nhad to have the whole vanishing business carefully explained, and the finding of the ring interested \r\nthem so much that for a while they forgot their own troubles. Balin in particular insisted on having the \r\nGollum story, riddles and all, told all over again, with the ring in its proper place. But after a time the \r\nlight began to fail, and then other questions were asked. Where were they, and where was their path, \r\nand where was there any food, and what were they going to do next? These questions they asked over \r\nand over again, and it was from little Bilbo that they seemed to expect to get the answers. From which \r\nyou can see that they had changed their opinion of Mr. Baggins very much, and had begun to have a \r\ngreat respect for him (as Gandalf had said they would). Indeed they really expected him to think of \r\nsome wonderful plan for helping them, and were not merely grumbling. They knew only too well that \r\nthey would soon all have been dead, if it had not been for the hobbit; and they thanked him many \r\ntimes. Some of them even got up and bowed right to the ground before him, though they fell over with \r\nthe effort, and could not get on their legs again for some time. Knowing the truth about the vanishing \r\ndid not lessen their opinion of Bilbo at all; for they saw that he had some wits, as well as luck and a \r\nmagic ring — and all three are very useful possessions. In fact they praised him so much that Bilbo \r\nbegan to feel there really was something of a bold adventurer about himself after all, though he would \r\nhave felt a lot bolder still, if there had been anything to eat. \r\n\r\nBut there was nothing, nothing at all; and none of them were fit to go and look for anything, or to \r\nsearch for the lost path. The lost path! No other idea would come into Bilbo’s tired head. He just sat \r\nstaring in front of him at the endless trees; and after a while they all fell silent again. All except Balin. \r\nLong after the others had stopped talking and shut their eyes, he kept on muttering and chuckling to \r\nhimself. \r\n\r\n“Gollum! Well I’m blest! So that’s how he sneaked past me, is it? Now I know! Just crept quietly \r\nalong did you, Mr. Baggins? Buttons all over the doorstep! Good old Bilbo — Bilbo — Bilbo — bo — bo \r\n— bo — ” And then he fell asleep, and there was complete silence for a long while. \r\n\r\nAll of a sudden Dwalin opened an eye, and looked round at them. “Where is Thorin?” he asked. \r\n\r\nIt was a terrible shock. Of course there were only thirteen of them, twelve dwarves and the hobbit. \r\nWhere indeed was Thorin? They wondered what evil fate had befallen him, magic or dark monsters; \r\nand shuddered as they lay lost in the forest. There they dropped off one by one into uncomfortable \r\nsleep full of horrible dreams, as evening wore to black night; and there we must leave them for the \r\npresent, too sick and weary to set guards or to take turns at watching. \r\n\r\nThorin had been caught much faster than they had. You remember Bilbo falling like a log into \r\nsleep, as he stepped into a circle of light? The next time it had been Thorin who stepped forward, and \r\nas the lights went out he fell like a stone enchanted. All the noise of the dwarves lost in the night, their \r\ncries as the spiders caught them and bound them, and all the sounds of the battle next day, had passed \r\nover him unheard. Then the Wood-elves had come to him, and bound him, and carried him away. \r\n\r\nThe feasting people were Wood-elves, of course. These are not wicked folk. If they have a fault it \r\nis distrust of strangers. Though their magic was strong, even in those days they were wary. They \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiffered from the High Elves of the West, and were more dangerous and less wise. For most of them \r\n(together with their scattered relations in the hills and mountains) were descended from the ancient \r\ntribes that never went to Faerie in the West. There the Fight-elves and the Deep-elves and the Sea- \r\nelves went and lived for ages, and grew fairer and wiser and more learned, and invented their magic \r\nand their cunning craft in the making of beautiful and marvellous things, before some came back into \r\nthe Wide World. In the Wide World the Wood-elves lingered in the twilight of our Sun and Moon, but \r\nloved best the stars; and they wandered in the great forests that grew tall in lands that are now lost. \r\nThey dwelt most often by the edges of the woods, from which they could escape at times to hunt, or to \r\nride and run over the open lands by moonlight or starlight; and after the coming of Men they took ever \r\nmore and more to the gloaming and the dusk. Still elves they were and remain, and that is Good \r\nPeople. \r\n\r\nIn a great cave some miles within the edge of Mirkwood on its eastern side there lived at this time \r\ntheir greatest king. Before his huge doors of stone a river ran out of the heights of the forest and \r\nflowed on and out into the marshes at the feet of the high wooded lands. This great cave, from which \r\ncountless smaller ones opened out on every side, wound far underground and had many passages and \r\nwide halls; but it was lighter and more wholesome than any goblin-dwelling, and neither so deep nor \r\nso dangerous. In fact the subjects of the king mostly lived and hunted in the open woods, and had \r\nhouses or huts on the ground and in the branches. The beeches were their favourite trees. The king’s \r\ncave was his palace, and the strong place of his treasure, and the fortress of his people against their \r\nenemies. \r\n\r\nIt was also the dungeon of his prisoners. So to the cave they dragged Thorin — not too gently, for \r\nthey did not love dwarves, and thought he was an enemy. In ancient days they had had wars with some \r\nof the dwarves, whom they accused of stealing their treasure. It is only fair to say that the dwarves \r\ngave a different account, and said that they only took what was their due, for the elf-king had \r\nbargained with them to shape his raw gold and silver, and had afterwards refused to give them their \r\npay. If the elf-king had a weakness it was for treasure, especially for silver and white gems; and \r\nthough his hoard was rich, he was ever eager for more, since he had not yet as great a treasure as other \r\nelf-lords of old. His people neither mined nor worked metals or jewels, nor did they bother much with \r\ntrade or with tilling the earth. All this was well known to every dwarf, though Thorin’ s family had had \r\nnothing to do with the old quarrel I have spoken of. Consequently Thorin was angry at their treatment \r\nof him, when they took their spell off him and he came to his senses; and also he was determined that \r\nno word of gold or jewels should be dragged out of him. \r\n\r\nThe king looked sternly on Thorin, when he was brought before him, and asked him many \r\nquestions. But Thorin would only say that he was starving. \r\n\r\n“Why did you and your folk three times try to attack my people at their merrymaking?” asked the \r\nking. \r\n\r\n“We did not attack them,” answered Thorin; “we came to beg, because we were starving.” \r\n\r\n“Where are your friends now, and what are they doing?” \r\n\r\n“I don’t know, but I expect starving in the forest.” \r\n\r\n“What were you doing in the forest?” \r\n\r\n“Booking for food and drink, because we were starving.” \r\n\r\n“But what brought you into the forest at all?” asked the king angrily. \r\n\r\nAt that Thorin shut his mouth and would not say another word. \r\n\r\n“Very well!” said the king. “Take him away and keep him safe, until he feels inclined to tell the \r\ntruth, even if he waits a hundred years.” \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen the elves put thongs on him, and shut him in one of the inmost caves with strong wooden \r\ndoors, and left him. They gave him food and drink, plenty of both, if not very fine; for Wood-elves \r\nwere not goblins, and were reasonably well-behaved even to their worst enemies, when they captured \r\nthem. The giant spiders were the only living things that they had no mercy upon. \r\n\r\nThere in the king’s dungeon poor Thorin lay; and after he had got over his thankfulness for bread \r\nand meat and water, he began to wonder what had become of his unfortunate friends. It was not very \r\nlong before he discovered; but that belongs to the next chapter and the beginning of another adventure \r\nin which the hobbit again showed his usefulness."

    "ChapterData": "The day after the battle with the spiders Bilbo and the dwarves made one last despairing effort to find \r\na way out before they died of hunger and thirst. They got up and staggered on in the direction which \r\neight out of the thirteen of them guessed to be the one in which the path lay; but they never found out \r\nif they were right. Such day as there ever was in the forest was fading once more into the blackness of \r\nnight, when suddenly out sprang the light of many torches all round them, like hundreds of red stars. \r\nOut leaped Wood-elves with their bows and spears and called the dwarves to halt. \r\n\r\nThere was no thought of a fight. Even if the dwarves had not been in such a state that they were \r\nactually glad to be captured, their small knives, the only weapons they had, would have been of no use \r\nagainst the arrows of the elves that could hit a bird’s eye in the dark. So they simply stopped dead and \r\nsat down and waited — all except Bilbo, who popped on his ring and slipped quickly to one side. That \r\nis why, when the elves bound the dwarves in a long line, one behind the other, and counted them, they \r\nnever found or counted the hobbit. \r\n\r\nNor did they hear or feel him trotting along well behind their torch-light as they led off their \r\nprisoners into the forest. Each dwarf was blindfold, but that did not make much difference, for even \r\nBilbo with the use of his eyes could not see where they were going, and neither he nor the others knew \r\nwhere they had started from anyway. Bilbo had all he could do to keep up with the torches, for the \r\nelves were making the dwarves go as fast as ever they could, sick and weary as they were. The king \r\nhad ordered them to make haste. Suddenly the torches stopped, and the hobbit had just time to catch \r\nthem up before they began to cross the bridge. This was the bridge that led across the river to the \r\nking’s doors. The water flowed dark and swift and strong beneath; and at the far end were gates before \r\nthe mouth of a huge cave that ran into the side of a steep slope covered with trees. There the great \r\nbeeches came right down to the bank, till their feet were in the stream. \r\n\r\nAcross the bridge the elves thrust their prisoners, but Bilbo hesitated in the rear. He did not at all \r\nlike the look of the cavern-mouth, and he only made up his mind not to desert his friends just in time \r\nto scuttle over at the heels of the last elves, before the great gates of the king closed behind them with \r\na clang. \r\n\r\nInside the passages were lit with red torch-light, and the elf-guards sang as they marched along the \r\ntwisting, crossing, and echoing paths. These were not like those of the goblin-cities; they were \r\nsmaller, less deep underground, and filled with a cleaner air. In a great hall with pillars hewn out of \r\nthe living stone sat the Elvenking on a chair of carven wood. On his head was a crown of berries and \r\nred leaves, for the autumn was come again. In the spring he wore a crown of woodland flowers. In his \r\nhand he held a carven staff of oak. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were brought before him; and though he looked grimly at them, he told his men to \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunbind them, for they were ragged and weary. “Besides they need no ropes in here,” said he. “There is \r\nno escape from my magic doors for those who are once brought inside.” \r\n\r\nLong and searchingly he questioned the dwarves about their doings, and where they were going to, \r\nand where they were coming from; but he got little more news out of them than out of Thorin. They \r\nwere surly and angry and did not even pretend to be polite. \r\n\r\n“What have we done, O king?” said Balin, who was the eldest left. “Is it a crime to be lost in the \r\nforest, to be hungry and thirsty, to be trapped by spiders? Are the spiders your tame beasts or your \r\npets, if killing them makes you angry?” \r\n\r\nSuch a question of course made the king angrier than ever, and he answered: “It is a crime to \r\nwander in my realm without leave. Do you forget that you were in my kingdom, using the road that \r\nmy people made? Did you not three times pursue and trouble my people in the forest and rouse the \r\nspiders with your riot and clamour? After all the disturbance you have made I have a right to know \r\nwhat brings you here, and if you will not tell me now, I will keep you all in prison until you have \r\nlearned sense and manners!” \r\n\r\nThen he ordered the dwarves each to be put in a separate cell and to be given food and drink, but \r\nnot to be allowed to pass the doors of their little prisons, until one at least of them was willing to tell \r\nhim all he wanted to know. But he did not tell them that Thorin was also a prisoner with him. It was \r\nBilbo who found that out. \r\n\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Baggins — it was a weary long time that he lived in that place all alone, and always in hiding, \r\nnever daring to take off his ring, hardly daring to sleep, even tucked away in the darkest and remotest \r\ncorners he could find. For something to do he took to wandering about the Elvenking’s palace. Magic \r\nshut the gates, but he could sometimes get out, if he was quick. Companies of the Wood-elves, \r\nsometimes with the king at their head, would from time to time ride out to hunt, or to other business in \r\nthe woods and in the lands to the East. Then if Bilbo was very nimble, he could slip out just behind \r\nthem; though it was a dangerous thing to do. More than once he was nearly caught in the doors, as they \r\nclashed together when the last elf passed; yet he did not dare to march among them because of his \r\nshadow (altogether thin and wobbly as it was in torchlight), or for fear of being bumped into and \r\ndiscovered. And when he did go out, which was not very often, he did no good. He did not wish to \r\ndesert the dwarves, and indeed he did not know where in the world to go without them. He could not \r\nkeep up with the hunting elves all the time they were out, so he never discovered the ways out of the \r\nwood, and was left to wander miserably in the forest, terrified of losing himself, until a chance came \r\nof returning. He was hungry too outside, for he was no hunter; but inside the caves he could pick up a \r\nliving of some sort by stealing food from store or table when no one was at hand. \r\n\r\n“I am like a burglar that can’t get away, but must go on miserably burgling the same house day \r\nafter day,” he thought. “This is the dreariest and dullest part of all this wretched, tiresome, \r\nuncomfortable adventure! I wish I was back in my hobbit-hole by my own warm fireside with the \r\nlamp shining!” He often wished, too, that he could get a message for help sent to the wizard, but that \r\nof course was quite impossible; and he soon realized that if anything was to be done, it would have to \r\nbe done by Mr. Baggins, alone and unaided. \r\n\r\nEventually, after a week or two of this sneaking sort of life, by watching and following the guards \r\nand taking what chances he could, he managed to find out where each dwarf was kept. He found all \r\ntheir twelve cells in different parts of the palace, and after a time he got to know his way about very \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwell. What was his surprise one day to overhear some of the guards talking and to learn that there was \r\nanother dwarf in prison too, in a specially deep dark place. He guessed at once, of course, that that was \r\nThorin; and after a while he found that his guess was right. At last after many difficulties he managed \r\nto find the place when no one was about, and to have a word with the chief of the dwarves. \r\n\r\nThorin was too wretched to be angry any longer at his misfortunes, and was even beginning to \r\nthink of telling the king all about his treasure and his quest (which shows how low-spirited he had \r\nbecome), when he heard Bilbo’s little voice at his keyhole. He could hardly believe his ears. Soon \r\nhowever he made up his mind that he could not be mistaken, and he came to the door and had a long \r\nwhispered talk with the hobbit on the other side. \r\n\r\nSo it was that Bilbo was able to take secretly Thorin’ s message to each of the other imprisoned \r\ndwarves, telling them that Thorin their chief was also in prison close at hand, and that no one was to \r\nreveal their errand to the king, not yet, nor before Thorin gave the word. For Thorin had taken heart \r\nagain hearing how the hobbit had rescued his companions from the spiders, and was determined once \r\nmore not to ransom himself with promises to the king of a share in the treasure, until all hope of \r\nescaping in any other way had disappeared; until in fact the remarkable Mr. Invisible Baggins (of \r\nwhom he began to have a very high opinion indeed) had altogether failed to think of something clever. \r\n\r\nThe other dwarves quite agreed when they got the message. They all thought their own shares in \r\nthe treasure (which they quite regarded as theirs, in spite of their plight and the still unconquered \r\ndragon) would suffer seriously if the Wood-elves claimed part of it, and they all trusted Bilbo. Just \r\nwhat Gandalf had said would happen, you see. Perhaps that was part of his reason for going off and \r\nleaving them. \r\n\r\nBilbo, however, did not feel nearly so hopeful as they did. He did not like being depended on by \r\neveryone, and he wished he had the wizard at hand. But that was no use: probably all the dark distance \r\nof Mirkwood lay between them. He sat and thought and thought, until his head nearly burst, but no \r\nbright idea would come. One invisible ring was a very fine thing, but it was not much good among \r\nfourteen. But of course, as you have guessed, he did rescue his friends in the end, and this is how it \r\nhappened. \r\n\r\nOne day, nosing and wandering about, Bilbo discovered a very interesting thing: the great gates \r\nwere not the only entrance to the caves. A stream flowed under part of the lowest regions of the \r\npalace, and joined the Forest River some way further to the east, beyond the steep slope out of which \r\nthe main mouth opened. Where this underground watercourse came forth from the hillside there was a \r\nwater-gate. There the rocky roof came down close to the surface of the stream, and from it a portcullis \r\ncould be dropped right to the bed of the river to prevent anyone coming in or out that way. But the \r\nportcullis was often open, for a good deal of traffic went out and in by the water-gate. If anyone had \r\ncome in that way, he would have found himself in a dark rough tunnel leading deep into the heart of \r\nthe hill; but at one point where it passed under the caves the roof had been cut away and covered with \r\ngreat oaken trapdoors. These opened upwards into the king’s cellars. There stood barrels, and barrels, \r\nand barrels; for the Wood-elves, and especially their king, were very fond of wine, though no vines \r\ngrew in those parts. The wine, and other goods, were brought from far away, from their kinsfolk in the \r\nSouth, or from the vineyards of Men in distant lands. \r\n\r\nHiding behind one of the largest barrels Bilbo discovered the trapdoors and their use, and lurking \r\nthere, listening to the talk of the king’s servants, he learned how the wine and other goods came up the \r\nrivers, or over land, to the Long Lake. It seemed a town of Men still throve there, built out on bridges \r\nfar into the water as a protection against enemies of all sorts, and especially against the dragon of the \r\nMountain. From Lake-town the barrels were brought up the Forest River. Often they were just tied \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntogether like big rafts and poled or rowed up the stream; sometimes they were loaded on to flat boats. \r\n\r\nWhen the barrels were empty the elves cast them through the trapdoors, opened the water-gate, and \r\nout the barrels floated on the stream, bobbing along, until they were carried by the current to a place \r\nfar down the river where the bank jutted out, near to the very eastern edge of Mirkwood. There they \r\nwere collected and tied together and floated back to Lake-town, which stood close to the point where \r\nthe Forest River flowed into the Long Lake. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor some time Bilbo sat and thought about this water-gate, and wondered if it could be used for the \r\nescape of his friends, and at last he had the desperate beginnings of a plan. \r\n\r\nThe evening meal had been taken to the prisoners. The guards were tramping away down the \r\npassages taking the torchlight with them and leaving everything in darkness. Then Bilbo heard the \r\nking’s butler bidding the chief of the guards good-night. \r\n\r\n“Now come with me,” he said, “and taste the new wine that has just come in. I shall be hard at \r\nwork tonight clearing the cellars of the empty wood, so let us have a drink first to help the labour.” \r\n“Very good,” laughed the chief of the guards. “Til taste with you, and see if it is fit for the king’s \r\ntable. There is a feast tonight and it would not do to send up poor stuff!” \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he heard this Bilbo was all in a flutter, for he saw that luck was with him and he had a chance at \r\nonce to try his desperate plan. He followed the two elves, until they entered a small cellar and sat \r\ndown at a table on which two large flagons were set. Soon they began to drink and laugh merrily. Luck \r\nof an unusual kind was with Bilbo then. It must be potent wine to make a wood-elf drowsy; but this \r\nwine, it would seem, was the heady vintage of the great gardens of Dorwinion, not meant for his \r\nsoldiers or his servants, but for the king’s feasts only, and for smaller bowls not for the butler’s great \r\nflagons. \r\n\r\nVery soon the chief guard nodded his head, then he laid it on the table and fell fast asleep. The \r\nbutler went on talking and laughing to himself for a while without seeming to notice, but soon his \r\nhead too nodded to the table, and he fell asleep and snored beside his friend. Then in crept the hobbit. \r\nVery soon the chief guard had no keys, but Bilbo was trotting as fast as he could along the passages \r\ntowards the cells. The great bunch seemed very heavy to his arms, and his heart was often in his \r\nmouth, in spite of his ring, for he could not prevent the keys from making every now and then a loud \r\nclink and clank, which put him all in a tremble. \r\n\r\nFirst he unlocked Balin’ s door, and locked it again carefully as soon as the dwarf was outside. \r\n\r\nBalin was most surprised, as you can imagine; but glad as he was to get out of his wearisome little \r\nstone room, he wanted to stop and ask questions, and know what Bilbo was going to do, and all about \r\nit. \r\n\r\n“No time now!” said the hobbit. “You just follow me! We must all keep together and not risk \r\ngetting separated. All of us must escape or none, and this is our last chance. If this is found out, \r\ngoodness knows where the king will put you next, with chains on your hands and feet too, I expect. \r\nDon’t argue, there’s a good fellow!” \r\n\r\nThen off he went from door to door, until his following had grown to twelve — none of them any \r\ntoo nimble, what with the dark, and what with their long imprisonment. Bilbo’s heart thumped every \r\ntime one of them bumped into another, or grunted or whispered in the dark. “Drat this dwarvish \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nracket!” he said to himself. But all went well, and they met no guards. As a matter of fact there was a \r\ngreat autumn feast in the woods that night, and in the halls above. Nearly all the king’s folk were \r\nmerrymaking. \r\n\r\nAt last after much blundering they came to Thorin’s dungeon, far down in a deep place and \r\nfortunately not far from the cellars. \r\n\r\n“Upon my word!” said Thorin, when Bilbo whispered to him to come out and join his friends, \r\n“Gandalf spoke true, as usual! A pretty fine burglar you make, it seems, when the time comes. I am \r\nsure we are all for ever at your service, whatever happens after this. But what comes next?” \r\n\r\nBilbo saw that the time had come to explain his idea, as far as he could; but he did not feel at all \r\nsure how the dwarves would take it. His fears were quite justified, for they did not like it a bit, and \r\nstarted grumbling loudly in spite of their danger. \r\n\r\n“We shall be bruised and battered to pieces, and drowned too, for certain!” they muttered. “We \r\nthought you had got some sensible notion, when you managed to get hold of the keys. This is a mad \r\nidea!” \r\n\r\n“Very well!” said Bilbo very downcast, and also rather annoyed. “Come along back to your nice \r\ncells, and I will lock you all in again, and you can sit there comfortably and think of a better plan — but \r\nI don’t suppose I shall ever get hold of the keys again, even if I feel inclined to try.” \r\n\r\nThat was too much for them, and they calmed down. In the end, of course, they had to do just what \r\nBilbo suggested, because it was obviously impossible for them to try and find their way into the upper \r\nhalls, or to fight their way out of gates that closed by magic; and it was no good grumbling in the \r\npassages until they were caught again. So following the hobbit, down into the lowest cellars they \r\ncrept. They passed a door through which the chief guard and the butler could be seen still happily \r\nsnoring with smiles upon their faces. The wine of Dorwinion brings deep and pleasant dreams. There \r\nwould be a different expression on the face of the chief guard next day, even though Bilbo, before they \r\nwent on, stole in and kind-heartedly put the keys back on his belt. \r\n\r\n“That will save him some of the trouble he is in for,” said Mr. Baggins to himself. “He wasn’t a \r\nbad fellow, and quite decent to the prisoners. It will puzzle them all too. They will think we had a very \r\nstrong magic to pass through all those locked doors and disappear. Disappear! We have got to get busy \r\nvery quick, if that is to happen!” \r\n\r\n\r\nBalin was told off to watch the guard and the butler and give warning if they stirred. The rest went into \r\nthe adjoining cellar with the trapdoors. There was little time to lose. Before long, as Bilbo knew, some \r\nelves were under orders to come down and help the butler get the empty barrels through the doors into \r\nthe stream. These were in fact already standing in rows in the middle of the floor waiting to be pushed \r\noff. Some of them were wine-barrels, and these were not much use, as they could not easily be opened \r\nat the end without a deal of noise, nor could they easily be secured again. But among them were \r\nseveral others, which had been used for bringing other stuffs, butter, apples, and all sorts of things, to \r\nthe king’s palace. \r\n\r\nThey soon found thirteen with room enough for a dwarf in each. In fact some were too roomy, and \r\nas they climbed in the dwarves thought anxiously of the shaking and the bumping they would get \r\ninside, though Bilbo did his best to find straw and other stuff to pack them in as cosily as could be \r\nmanaged in a short time. At last twelve dwarves were stowed. Thorin had given a lot of trouble, and \r\nturned and twisted in his tub and grumbled like a large dog in a small kennel; while Balin, who came \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlast, made a great fuss about his air-holes and said he was stifling, even before his lid was on. Bilbo \r\nhad done what he could to close holes in the sides of the barrels, and to fix on all the lids as safely as \r\ncould be managed, and now he was left alone again, running round putting the finishing touches to the \r\npacking, and hoping against hope that his plan would come off. \r\n\r\nIt had not been done a bit too soon. Only a minute or two after Balin’ s lid had been fitted on there \r\ncame the sound of voices and the flicker of lights. A number of elves came laughing and talking into \r\nthe cellars and singing snatches of song. They had left a merry feast in one of the halls and were bent \r\non returning as soon as they could. \r\n\r\n“Where’s old Galion, the butler?” said one. “I haven’t seen him at the tables tonight. He ought to \r\nbe here now to show us what is to be done.” \r\n\r\n“I shall be angry if the old slowcoach is late,” said another. “I have no wish to waste time down \r\nhere while the song is up!” \r\n\r\n“Ha, ha!” came a cry. “Here’s the old villain with his head on a jug! He’s been having a little feast \r\nall to himself and his friend the captain.” \r\n\r\n“Shake him! Wake him!” shouted the others impatiently. \r\n\r\nGalion was not at all pleased at being shaken or wakened, and still less at being laughed at. “You’re \r\nall late,” he grumbled. “Here am I waiting and waiting down here, while you fellows drink and make \r\nmerry and forget your tasks. Small wonder if I fall asleep from weariness!” \r\n\r\n“Small wonder,” said they, “when the explanation stands close at hand in a jug! Come give us a \r\ntaste of your sleeping-draught before we fall to! No need to wake the turnkey yonder. He has had his \r\nshare by the looks of it.” \r\n\r\nThen they drank once round and became mighty merry all of a sudden. But they did not quite lose \r\ntheir wits. “Save us, Galion!” cried some, “you began your feasting early and muddled your wits! You \r\nhave stacked some full casks here instead of the empty ones, if there is anything in weight.” \r\n\r\n“Get on with the work!” growled the butler. “There is nothing in the feeling of weight in an idle \r\ntoss-pot’s arms. These are the ones to go and no others. Do as I say!” \r\n\r\n“Very well, very well,” they answered rolling the barrels to the opening. “On your head be it, if the \r\nking’s full buttertubs and his best wine is pushed into the river for the Lake-men to feast on for \r\nnothing!” \r\n\r\n\r\nRoll — roll — roll — roll, \r\nroll-roll-rolling down the hole! \r\nHeave ho! Splash plump! \r\n\r\nDown they go, down they bump! \r\n\r\n\r\nSo they sang as first one barrel and then another rumbled to the dark opening and was pushed over \r\ninto the cold water some feet below. Some were barrels really empty, some were tubs neatly packed \r\nwith a dwarf each; but down they all went, one after another, with many a clash and a bump, thudding \r\non top of ones below, smacking into the water, jostling against the walls of the tunnel, knocking into \r\none another, and bobbing away down the current. \r\n\r\nIt was just at this moment that Bilbo suddenly discovered the weak point in his plan. Most likely \r\nyou saw it some time ago and have been laughing at him; but I don’t suppose you would have done \r\nhalf as well yourselves in his place. Of course he was not in a barrel himself, nor was there anyone to \r\npack him in, even if there had been a chance! It looked as if he would certainly lose his friends this \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime (nearly all of them had already disappeared through the dark trap-door), and get utterly left \r\nbehind and have to stay lurking as a permanent burglar in the elf-caves for ever. For even if he could \r\nhave escaped through the upper gates at once, he had precious small chance of ever finding the \r\ndwarves again. He did not know the way by land to the place where the barrels were collected. He \r\nwondered what on earth would happen to them without him; for he had not had time to tell the \r\ndwarves all that he had learned, or what he had meant to do, once they were out of the wood. \r\n\r\nWhile all these thoughts were passing through his mind, the elves being very merry began to sing a \r\nsong round the river-door. Some had already gone to haul on the ropes which pulled up the portcullis \r\nat the water-gate so as to let out the barrels as soon as they were all afloat below. \r\n\r\n\r\nDown the swift dark stream you go \r\nBack to lands you once did know! \r\nLeave the halls and caverns deep, \r\nLeave the northern mountains steep, \r\nWhere the forest wide and dim \r\nStoops in shadow grey and grim! \r\nFloat beyond the world of trees \r\nOut into the whispering breeze, \r\n\r\nPast the rushes, past the reeds, \r\n\r\nPast the marsh ’ s waving weeds, \r\nThrough the mist that riseth white \r\nUp from mere and pool at night! \r\nFollow, follow stars that leap \r\nUp the heavens cold and steep; \r\n\r\nTurn when dawn comes over land, \r\nOver rapid, over sand, \r\n\r\nSouth away! and South away! \r\n\r\nSeek the sunlight and the day, \r\n\r\nBack to pasture, back to mead, \r\nWhere the kine and oxen feed! \r\n\r\nBack to gardens on the hills \r\nWhere the berry swells and fills \r\nUnder sunlight, under day! \r\n\r\nSouth away! and South away! \r\n\r\nDown the swift dark stream you go \r\nBack to lands you once did know! \r\n\r\n\r\nNow the very last barrel was being rolled to the doors! In despair and not knowing what else to do, \r\npoor little Bilbo caught hold of it and was pushed over the edge with it. Down into the water he fell, \r\nsplash! into the cold dark water with the barrel on top of him. \r\n\r\nHe came up again spluttering and clinging to the wood like a rat, but for all his efforts he could not \r\nscramble on top. Every time he tried, the barrel rolled round and ducked him under again. It was really \r\nempty, and floated light as a cork. Though his ears were full of water, he could hear the elves still \r\nsinging in the cellar above. Then suddenly the trap-doors fell to with a boom and their voices faded \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naway. He was in the dark tunnel floating in icy water, all alone — for you cannot count friends that are \r\nall packed up in barrels. \r\n\r\nVery soon a grey patch came in the darkness ahead. He heard the creak of the water-gate being \r\nhauled up, and he found that he was in the midst of a bobbing and bumping mass of casks and tubs all \r\npressing together to pass under the arch and get out into the open stream. He had as much as he could \r\ndo to prevent himself from being hustled and battered to bits; but at last the jostling crowd began to \r\nbreak up and swing off, one by one, under the stony arch and away. Then he saw that it would have \r\nbeen no good even if he had managed to get astride his barrel, for there was no room to spare, not even \r\nfor a hobbit, between its top and the suddenly stooping roof where the gate was. \r\n\r\n\r\nOut they went under the overhanging branches of the trees on either bank. Bilbo wondered what the \r\ndwarves were feeling and whether a lot of water was getting into their tubs. Some of those that bobbed \r\nalong by him in the gloom seemed pretty low in the water, and he guessed that these had dwarves \r\ninside. \r\n\r\n“I do hope I put the lids on tight enough!” he thought, but before long he was worrying too much \r\nabout himself to remember the dwarves. He managed to keep his head above the water, but he was \r\nshivering with the cold, and he wondered if he would die of it before the luck turned, and how much \r\nlonger he would be able to hang on, and whether he should risk the chance of letting go and trying to \r\nswim to the bank. \r\n\r\nThe luck turned all right before long: the eddying current carried several barrels close ashore at one \r\npoint and there for a while they stuck against some hidden root. Then Bilbo took the opportunity of \r\nscrambling up the side of his barrel while it was held steady against another. Up he crawled like a \r\ndrowned rat, and lay on the top spread out to keep the balance as best he could. The breeze was cold \r\nbut better than the water, and he hoped he would not suddenly roll off again when they started off once \r\nmore. \r\n\r\nBefore long the barrels broke free again and turned and twisted off down the stream, and out into \r\nthe main current. Then he found it quite as difficult to stick on as he had feared; but he managed it \r\nsomehow, though it was miserably uncomfortable. Luckily he was very light, and the barrel was a \r\ngood big one and being rather leaky had now shipped a small amount of water. All the same it was like \r\ntrying to ride, without bridle or stirrups, a round-bellied pony that was always thinking of rolling on \r\nthe grass. \r\n\r\nIn this way at last Mr. Baggins came to a place where the trees on either hand grew thinner. He \r\ncould see the paler sky between them. The dark river opened suddenly wide, and there it was joined to \r\nthe main water of the Forest River flowing down in haste from the king’s great doors. There was a dim \r\nsheet of water no longer overshadowed, and on its sliding surface there were dancing and broken \r\nreflections of clouds and of stars. Then the hurrying water of the Forest River swept all the company \r\nof casks and tubs away to the north bank, in which it had eaten out a wide bay. This had a shingly \r\nshore under hanging banks and was walled at the eastern end by a little jutting cape of hard rock. On \r\nthe shallow shore most of the barrels ran aground, though a few went on to bump against the stony \r\npier. \r\n\r\nThere were people on the look-out on the banks. They quickly poled and pushed all the barrels \r\ntogether into the shallows, and when they had counted them they roped them together and left them \r\ntill the morning. Poor dwarves! Bilbo was not badly off now. He slipped from his barrel and waded \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nashore, and then sneaked along to some huts that he could see near the water’s edge. He no longer \r\nthought twice about picking up a supper uninvited if he got the chance, he had been obliged to do it for \r\nso long, and he knew now only too well what it was to be really hungry, not merely politely interested \r\nin the dainties of a well-filled larder. Also he had caught a glimpse of a fire through the trees, and that \r\nappealed to him with his dripping and ragged clothes clinging to him cold and clammy. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no need to tell you much of his adventures that night, for now we are drawing near the end of \r\nthe eastward journey and coming to the last and greatest adventure, so we must hurry on. Of course \r\nhelped by his magic ring he got on very well at first, but he was given away in the end by his wet \r\nfootsteps and the trail of drippings that he left wherever he went or sat; and also he began to snivel, \r\nand wherever he tried to hide he was found out by the terrific explosions of his suppressed sneezes. \r\nVery soon there was a fine commotion in the village by the riverside; but Bilbo escaped into the \r\nwoods carrying a loaf and a leather bottle of wine and a pie that did not belong to him. The rest of the \r\nnight he had to pass wet as he was and far from a fire, but the bottle helped him to do that, and he \r\nactually dozed a little on some dry leaves, even though the year was getting late and the air was chilly. \r\n\r\nHe woke again with a specially loud sneeze. It was already grey morning, and there was a merry \r\nracket down by the river. They were making up a raft of barrels, and the raft-elves would soon be \r\nsteering it off down the stream to Lake-town. Bilbo sneezed again. He was no longer dripping but he \r\nfelt cold all over. He scrambled down as fast as his stiff legs would take him and managed just in time \r\nto get on to the mass of casks without being noticed in the general bustle. Luckily there was no sun at \r\nthe time to cast an awkward shadow, and for a mercy he did not sneeze again for a good while. \r\n\r\nThere was a mighty pushing of poles. The elves that were standing in the shallow water heaved and \r\nshoved. The barrels now all lashed together creaked and fretted. \r\n\r\n“This is a heavy load!” some grumbled. “They float too deep — some of these are never empty. If \r\nthey had come ashore in the daylight, we might have had a look inside,” they said. \r\n\r\n“No time now!” cried the raftman. “Shove off!” And off they went at last, slowly at first, until they \r\nhad passed the point of rock where other elves stood to fend them off with poles, and then quicker and \r\nquicker as they caught the main stream and went sailing away down, down towards the Lake. \r\n\r\nThey had escaped the dungeons of the king and were through the wood, but whether alive or dead \r\nstill remains to be seen."

    "ChapterData": "The day grew lighter and warmer as they floated along. After a while the river rounded a steep \r\nshoulder of land that came down upon their left. Under its rocky feet like an inland cliff the deepest \r\nstream had flowed lapping and bubbling. Suddenly the cliff fell away. The shores sank. The trees \r\nended. Then Bilbo saw a sight: \r\n\r\nThe lands opened wide about him, filled with the waters of the river which broke up and wandered \r\nin a hundred winding courses, or halted in marshes and pools dotted with isles on every side; but still a \r\nstrong water flowed on steadily through the midst. And far away, its dark head in a torn cloud, there \r\nloomed the Mountain! Its nearest neighbours to the North-East and the tumbled land that joined it to \r\nthem could not be seen. All alone it rose and looked across the marshes to the forest. The Lonely \r\nMountain! Bilbo had come far and through many adventures to see it, and now he did not like the look \r\nof it in the least. \r\n\r\nAs he listened to the talk of the raftmen and pieced together the scraps of information they let fall, \r\nhe soon realized that he was very fortunate ever to have seen it at all, even from this distance. Dreary \r\nas had been his imprisonment and unpleasant as was his position (to say nothing of the poor dwarves \r\nunderneath him) still, he had been more lucky than he had guessed. The talk was all of the trade that \r\ncame and went on the waterways and the growth of the traffic on the river, as the roads out of the East \r\ntowards Mirkwood vanished or fell into disuse; and of the bickerings of the Lake-men and the Wood- \r\nelves about the upkeep of the Forest River and the care of the banks. Those lands had changed much \r\nsince the days when dwarves dwelt in the Mountain, days which most people now remembered only as \r\na very shadowy tradition. They had changed even in recent years, and since the last news that Gandalf \r\nhad had of them. Great floods and rains had swollen the waters that flowed east; and there had been an \r\nearthquake or two (which some were inclined to attribute to the dragon — alluding to him chiefly with \r\na curse and an ominous nod in the direction of the Mountain). The marshes and bogs had spread wider \r\nand wider on either side. Paths had vanished, and many a rider and wanderer too, if they had tried to \r\nfind the lost ways across. The elf-road through the wood which the dwarves had followed on the \r\nadvice of Beorn now came to a doubtful and little used end at the eastern edge of the forest; only the \r\nriver offered any longer a safe way from the skirts of Mirkwood in the North to the mountain- \r\nshadowed plains beyond, and the river was guarded by the Wood-elves’ king. \r\n\r\nSo you see Bilbo had come in the end by the only road that was any good. It might have been some \r\ncomfort to Mr. Baggins shivering on the barrels, if he had known that news of this had reached \r\nGandalf far away and given him great anxiety, and that he was in fact finishing his other business \r\n(which does not come into this tale) and getting ready to come in search of Thorin’s company. But \r\nBilbo did not know it. \r\n\r\nAll he knew was that the river seemed to go on and on and on for ever, and he was hungry, and had \r\na nasty cold in the nose, and did not like the way the Mountain seemed to frown at him and threaten \r\nhim as it drew ever nearer. After a while, however, the river took a more southerly course and the \r\nMountain receded again, and at last, late in the day the shores grew rocky, the river gathered all its \r\n\r\n\r\nwandering waters together into a deep and rapid flood, and they swept along at great speed. \r\n\r\nThe sun had set when turning with another sweep towards the East the forest-river rushed into the \r\nLong Lake. There it had a wide mouth with stony clifflike gates at either side whose feet were piled \r\nwith shingles. The Long Lake! Bilbo had never imagined that any water that was not the sea could \r\nlook so big. It was so wide that the opposite shores looked small and far, but it was so long that its \r\nnortherly end, which pointed towards the Mountain, could not be seen at all. Only from the map did \r\nBilbo know that away up there, where the stars of the Wain were already twinkling, the Running River \r\ncame down into the lake from Dale and with the Lorest River filled with deep waters what must once \r\nhave been a great deep rocky valley. At the southern end the doubled waters poured out again over \r\nhigh waterfalls and ran away hurriedly to unknown lands. In the still evening air the noise of the falls \r\ncould be heard like a distant roar. \r\n\r\nNot far from the mouth of the Lorest River was the strange town he heard the elves speak of in the \r\nking’s cellars. It was not built on the shore, though there were a few huts and buildings there, but right \r\nout on the surface of the lake, protected from the swirl of the entering river by a promontory of rock \r\nwhich formed a calm bay. A great bridge made of wood ran out to where on huge piles made of forest \r\ntrees was built a busy wooden town, not a town of elves but of Men, who still dared to dwell here \r\nunder the shadow of the distant dragon-mountain. They still throve on the trade that came up the great \r\nriver from the South and was carted past the falls to their town; but in the great days of old, when Dale \r\nin the North was rich and prosperous, they had been wealthy and powerful, and there had been fleets of \r\nboats on the waters, and some were filled with gold and some with warriors in armour, and there had \r\nbeen wars and deeds which were now only a legend. The rotting piles of a greater town could still be \r\nseen along the shores when the waters sank in a drought. \r\n\r\nBut men remembered little of all that, though some still sang old songs of the dwarf-kings of the \r\nMountain, Thror and Thrain of the race of Durin, and of the coming of the Dragon, and the fall of the \r\nlords of Dale. Some sang too that Thror and Thrain would come back one day and gold would flow in \r\nrivers, through the mountain-gates, and all that land would be filled with new song and new laughter. \r\nBut this pleasant legend did not much affect their daily business. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the raft of barrels came in sight boats rowed out from the piles of the town, and voices \r\nhailed the raft-steerers. Then ropes were cast and oars were pulled, and soon the raft was drawn out of \r\n\r\n\r\nthe current of the Forest River and towed away round the high shoulder of rock into the little bay of \r\nLake-town. There it was moored not far from the shoreward head of the great bridge. Soon men would \r\ncome up from the South and take some of the casks away, and others they would fill with goods they \r\nhad brought to be taken back up the stream to the Wood-elves’ home. In the meanwhile the barrels \r\nwere left afloat while the elves of the raft and the boatmen went to feast in Lake-town. \r\n\r\nThey would have been surprised, if they could have seen what happened down by the shore, after \r\nthey had gone and the shades of night had fallen. First of all a barrel was cut loose by Bilbo and \r\npushed to the shore and opened. Groans came from inside, and out crept a most unhappy dwarf. Wet \r\nstraw was in his draggled beard; he was so sore and stiff, so bruised and buffeted he could hardly stand \r\nor stumble through the shallow water to lie groaning on the shore. He had a famished and a savage \r\nlook like a dog that has been chained and forgotten in a kennel for a week. It was Thorin, but you \r\ncould only have told it by his golden chain, and by the colour of his now dirty and tattered sky-blue \r\nhood with its tarnished silver tassel. It was some time before he would be even polite to the hobbit. \r\n\r\n“Well, are you alive or are you dead?” asked Bilbo quite crossly. Perhaps he had forgotten that he \r\nhad had at least one good meal more than the dwarves, and also the use of his arms and legs, not to \r\nspeak of a greater allowance of air. “Are you still in prison, or are you free? If you want food, and if \r\nyou want to go on with this silly adventure — it’s yours after all and not mine — you had better slap \r\nyour arms and rub your legs and try and help me get the others out while there is a chance!” \r\n\r\nThorin of course saw the sense of this, so after a few more groans he got up and helped the hobbit \r\nas well as he could. In the darkness floundering in the cold water they had a difficult and very nasty \r\njob finding which were the right barrels. Knocking outside and calling only discovered about six \r\ndwarves that could answer. These were unpacked and helped ashore where they sat or lay muttering \r\nand moaning; they were so soaked and bruised and cramped that they could hardly yet realize their \r\nrelease or be properly thankful for it. \r\n\r\nDwalin and Balin were two of the most unhappy, and it was no good asking them to help. Bifur and \r\nBofur were less knocked about and drier, but they lay down and would do nothing. Fili and Kili, \r\nhowever, who were young (for dwarves) and had also been packed more neatly with plenty of straw \r\ninto smaller casks, came out more or less smiling, with only a bruise or two and a stiffness that soon \r\nwore off. \r\n\r\n“I hope I never smell the smell of apples again!” said Fili. “My tub was full of it. To smell apples \r\neverlastingly when you can scarcely move and are cold and sick with hunger is maddening. I could eat \r\nanything in the wide world now, for hours on end — but not an apple!” \r\n\r\nWith the willing help of Fili and Kili, Thorin and Bilbo at last discovered the remainder of the \r\ncompany and got them out. Poor fat Bombur was asleep or senseless; Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin and Gloin \r\nwere waterlogged and seemed only half alive; they all had to be carried one by one and laid helpless \r\non the shore. \r\n\r\n“Well! Here we are!” said Thorin. “And I suppose we ought to thank our stars and Mr. Baggins. I \r\nam sure he has a right to expect it, though I wish he could have arranged a more comfortable journey. \r\nStill — all very much at your service once more, Mr. Baggins. No doubt we shall feel properly grateful, \r\nwhen we are fed and recovered. In the meanwhile what next?” \r\n\r\n“I suggest Lake-town,” said Bilbo. “What else is there?” \r\n\r\nNothing else could, of course, be suggested; so leaving the others Thorin and Fili and Kili and the \r\nhobbit went along the shore to the great bridge. There were guards at the head of it, but they were not \r\nkeeping very careful watch, for it was so long since there had been any real need. Except for \r\noccasional squabbles about river-tolls they were friends with the Wood-elves. Other folk were far \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naway; and some of the younger people in the town openly doubted the existence of any dragon in the \r\nmountain, and laughed at the greybeards and gammers who said that they had seen him flying in the \r\nsky in their young days. That being so it is not surprising that the guards were drinking and laughing \r\nby a fire in their hut, and did not hear the noise of the unpacking of the dwarves or the footsteps of the \r\nfour scouts. Their astonishment was enormous when Thorin Oakenshield stepped in through the door. \r\n\r\n“Who are you and what do you want?” they shouted leaping to their feet and groping for weapons. \r\n\r\n“Thorin son of Thrain son of Thror King under the Mountain!” said the dwarf in a loud voice, and \r\nhe looked it, in spite of his torn clothes and draggled hood. The gold gleamed on his neck and waist; \r\nhis eyes were dark and deep. “I have come back. I wish to see the Master of your town!” \r\n\r\nThen there was tremendous excitement. Some of the more foolish ran out of the hut as if they \r\nexpected the Mountain to go golden in the night and all the waters of the lake turn yellow right away. \r\nThe captain of the guard came forward. \r\n\r\n“And who are these?” he asked, pointing to Fili and Kili and Bilbo. \r\n\r\n“The sons of my father’s daughter,” answered Thorin, “Fili and Kili of the race of Durin, and Mr. \r\nBaggins who has travelled with us out of the West.” \r\n\r\n“If you come in peace lay down your arms!” said the captain. \r\n\r\n“We have none,” said Thorin, and it was true enough: their knives had been taken from them by the \r\nwood-elves, and the great sword Orcrist too. Bilbo had his short sword, hidden as usual, but he said \r\nnothing about that. “We have no need of weapons, who return at last to our own as spoken of old. Nor \r\ncould we fight against so many. Take us to your master!” \r\n\r\n“He is at feast,” said the captain. \r\n\r\n“Then all the more reason for taking us to him,” burst in Fili, who was getting impatient at these \r\nsolemnities. “We are worn and famished after our long road and we have sick comrades. Now make \r\nhaste and let us have no more words, or your master may have something to say to you.” \r\n\r\n“Follow me then,” said the captain, and with six men about them he led them over the bridge \r\nthrough the gates and into the market-place of the town. This was a wide circle of quiet water \r\nsurrounded by the tall piles on which were built the greater houses, and by long wooden quays with \r\nmany steps and ladders going down to the surface of the lake. From one great hall shone many lights \r\nand there came the sound of many voices. They passed its doors and stood blinking in the light \r\nlooking at long tables filled with folk. \r\n\r\n“I am Thorin son of Thrain son of Thror King under the Mountain! I return!” cried Thorin in a loud \r\nvoice from the door, before the captain could say anything. \r\n\r\nAll leaped to their feet. The Master of the town sprang from his great chair. But none rose in \r\ngreater surprise than the raft-men of the elves who were sitting at the lower end of the hall. Pressing \r\nforward before the Master’s table they cried: \r\n\r\n“These are prisoners of our king that have escaped, wandering vagabond dwarves that could not \r\ngive any good account of themselves, sneaking through the woods and molesting our people!” \r\n\r\n“Is this true?” asked the Master. As a matter of fact he thought it far more likely than the return of \r\nthe King under the Mountain, if any such person had ever existed. \r\n\r\n“It is true that we were wrongfully waylaid by the Elvenking and imprisoned without cause as we \r\njourneyed back to our own land,” answered Thorin. “But lock nor bar may hinder the homecoming \r\nspoken of old. Nor is this town in the Wood-elves’ realm. I speak to the Master of the town of the Men \r\nof the Lake, not to the raft-men of the king.” \r\n\r\nThen the Master hesitated and looked from one to the other. The Elvenking was very powerful in \r\nthose parts and the Master wished for no enmity with him, nor did he think much of old songs, giving \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis mind to trade and tolls, to cargoes and gold, to which habit he owed his position. Others were of \r\ndifferent mind, however, and quickly the matter was settled without him. The news had spread from \r\nthe doors of the hall like fire through all the town. People were shouting inside the hall and outside it. \r\nThe quays were thronged with hurrying feet. Some began to sing snatches of old songs concerning the \r\nreturn of the King under the Mountain; that it was Thror’s grandson not Thror himself that had come \r\nback did not bother them at all. Others took up the song and it rolled loud and high over the lake. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe King beneath the mountains, \r\nThe King of carven stone, \r\n\r\nThe lord of silver fountains \r\nShall come into his own! \r\n\r\n\r\nHis crown shall be upholden, \r\nHis harp shall be restrung, \r\nHis halls shall echo golden \r\nTo songs of yore re-sung. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe woods shall wave on mountains \r\nAnd grass beneath the sun; \r\n\r\nHis wealth shall flow in fountains \r\nAnd the rivers golden run. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe streams shall run in gladness, \r\nThe lakes shall shine and burn, \r\nAll sorrow fail and sadness \r\nAt the Mountain-king’s return! \r\n\r\n\r\nSo they sang, or very like that, only there was a great deal more of it, and there was much shouting \r\nas well as the music of harps and of fiddles mixed up with it. Indeed such excitement had not been \r\nknown in the town in the memory of the oldest grandfather. The Wood-elves themselves began to \r\nwonder greatly and even to be afraid. They did not know of course how Thorin had escaped, and they \r\nbegan to think their king might have made a serious mistake. As for the Master he saw there was \r\nnothing else for it but to obey the general clamour, for the moment at any rate, and to pretend to \r\nbelieve that Thorin was what he said. So he gave up to him his own great chair and set Fili and Kili \r\nbeside him in places of honour. Even Bilbo was given a seat at the high table, and no explanation of \r\nwhere he came in — no songs had alluded to him even in the obscurest way — was asked for in the \r\ngeneral bustle. \r\n\r\nSoon afterwards the other dwarves were brought into the town amid scenes of astonishing \r\nenthusiasm. They were all doctored and fed and housed and pampered in the most delightful and \r\nsatisfactory fashion. A large house was given up to Thorin and his company; boats and rowers were \r\nput at their service; and crowds sat outside and sang songs all day, or cheered if any dwarf showed so \r\nmuch as his nose. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the songs were old ones; but some of them were quite new and spoke confidently of the \r\nsudden death of the dragon and of cargoes of rich presents coming down the river to Lake-town. These \r\nwere inspired largely by the Master and they did not particularly please the dwarves, but in the \r\nmeantime they were well contented and they quickly grew fat and strong again. Indeed within a week \r\nthey were quite recovered, fitted out in fine cloth of their proper colours, with beards combed and \r\ntrimmed, and proud steps. Thorin looked and walked as if his kingdom was already regained and \r\nSmaug chopped up into little pieces. \r\n\r\nThen, as he had said, the dwarves’ good feeling towards the little hobbit grew stronger every day. \r\nThere were no more groans or grumbles. They drank his health, and they patted him on the back, and \r\nthey made a great fuss of him; which was just as well, for he was not feeling particularly cheerful. He \r\nhad not forgotten the look of the Mountain, nor the thought of the dragon, and he had besides a \r\nshocking cold. For three days he sneezed and coughed, and he could not go out, and even after that his \r\nspeeches at banquets were limited to “Thag you very buch.” \r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the Wood-elves had gone back up the Forest River with their cargoes, and there was \r\ngreat excitement in the king’s palace. I have never heard what happened to the chief of the guards and \r\nthe butler. Nothing of course was ever said about keys or barrels while the dwarves stayed in Lake- \r\ntown, and Bilbo was careful never to become invisible. Still, I daresay, more was guessed than was \r\nknown, though doubtless Mr. Baggins remained a bit of a mystery. In any case the king knew now the \r\ndwarves’ errand, or thought he did, and he said to himself: \r\n\r\n“Very well! We’ll see! No treasure will come back through Mirkwood without my having \r\nsomething to say in the matter. But I expect they will all come to a bad end, and serve them right!” He \r\nat any rate did not believe in dwarves fighting and killing dragons like Smaug, and he strongly \r\nsuspected attempted burglary or something like it — which shows he was a wise elf and wiser than the \r\nmen of the town, though not quite right, as we shall see in the end. He sent out his spies about the \r\nshores of the lake and as far northward towards the Mountain as they would go, and waited. \r\n\r\nAt the end of a fortnight Thorin began to think of departure. While the enthusiasm still lasted in the \r\ntown was the time to get help. It would not do to let everything cool down with delay. So he spoke to \r\nthe Master and his councillors and said that soon he and his company must go on towards the \r\nMountain. \r\n\r\nThen for the first time the Master was surprised and a little frightened; and he wondered if Thorin \r\nwas after all really a descendant of the old kings. He had never thought that the dwarves would \r\nactually dare to approach Smaug, but believed they were frauds who would sooner or later be \r\ndiscovered and be turned out. He was wrong. Thorin, of course, was really the grandson of the King \r\nunder the Mountain, and there is no knowing what a dwarf will not dare and do for revenge or the \r\nrecovery of his own. \r\n\r\nBut the Master was not sorry at all to let them go. They were expensive to keep, and their arrival \r\nhad turned things into a long holiday in which business was at a standstill. “Let them go and bother \r\nSmaug, and see how he welcomes them!” he thought. “Certainly, O Thorin Thrain’s son Thror’s son!” \r\nwas what he said. “You must claim your own. The hour is at hand, spoken of old. What help we can \r\noffer shall be yours, and we trust to your gratitude when your kingdom is regained.” \r\n\r\nSo one day, although autumn was now getting far on, and winds were cold, and leaves were falling \r\nfast, three large boats left Lake-town, laden with rowers, dwarves, Mr. Baggins, and many provisions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHorses and ponies had been sent round by circuitous paths to meet them at their appointed landing- \r\nplace. The Master and his councillors bade them farewell from the great steps of the town-hall that \r\nwent down to the lake. People sang on the quays and out of windows. The white oars dipped and \r\nsplashed, and off they went north up the lake on the last stage of their long journey. The only person \r\nthoroughly unhappy was Bilbo."

    "ChapterData": "In two days going they rowed right up the Long Lake and passed out into the River Running, and now \r\nthey could all see the Lonely Mountain towering grim and tall before them. The stream was strong and \r\ntheir going slow. At the end of the third day, some miles up the river, they drew in to the left or \r\nwestern bank and disembarked. Here they were joined by the horses with other provisions and \r\nnecessaries and the ponies for their own use that had been sent to meet them. They packed what they \r\ncould on the ponies and the rest was made into a store under a tent, but none of the men of the town \r\nwould stay with them even for the night so near the shadow of the Mountain. \r\n\r\n“Not at any rate until the songs have come true!” said they. It was easier to believe in the Dragon \r\nand less easy to believe in Thorin in these wild parts. Indeed their stores had no need of any guard, for \r\nall the land was desolate and empty. So their escort left them, making off swiftly down the river and \r\nthe shoreward paths, although the night was already drawing on. \r\n\r\nThey spent a cold and lonely night and their spirits fell. The next day they set out again. Balin and \r\nBilbo rode behind, each leading another pony heavily laden beside him; the others were some way \r\nahead picking out a slow road, for there were no paths. They made north-west, slanting away from the \r\nRiver Running, and drawing ever nearer and nearer to a great spur of the Mountain that was flung out \r\nsouthwards towards them. \r\n\r\nIt was a weary journey, and a quiet and stealthy one. There was no laughter or song or sound of \r\nharps, and the pride and hopes which had stirred in their hearts at the singing of old songs by the lake \r\ndied away to a plodding gloom. They knew that they were drawing near to the end of their journey, \r\nand that it might be a very horrible end. The land about them grew bleak and barren, though once, as \r\nThorin told them, it had been green and fair. There was little grass, and before long there was neither \r\nbush nor tree, and only broken and blackened stumps to speak of ones long vanished. They were come \r\nto the Desolation of the Dragon, and they were come at the waning of the year. \r\n\r\n\r\nThey reached the skirts of the Mountain all the same without meeting any danger or any sign of the \r\nDragon other than the wilderness he had made about his lair. The Mountain lay dark and silent before \r\nthem and ever higher above them. They made their first camp on the western side of the great southern \r\nspur, which ended in a height called Ravenhill. On this there had been an old watch-post; but they \r\ndared not climb it yet, it was too exposed. \r\n\r\nBefore setting out to search the western spurs of the Mountain for the hidden door, on which all \r\ntheir hopes rested, Thorin sent out a scouting expedition to spy out the land to the South where the \r\nFront \r\n\r\nGate stood. For this purpose he chose Balin and Fili and Kili, and with them went Bilbo. They \r\nmarched under the grey and silent cliffs to the feet of Ravenhill. There the river, after winding a wide \r\nloop over the valley of Dale, turned from the Mountain on its road to the Lake, flowing swift and \r\nnoisily. Its bank was bare and rocky, tall and steep above the stream; and gazing out from it over the \r\n\r\n\r\nnarrow water, foaming and splashing among many boulders, they could see in the wide valley \r\nshadowed by the Mountain’s arms the grey ruins of ancient houses, towers, and walls. \r\n\r\n“There lies all that is left of Dale,” said Balin. “The mountain’s sides were green with woods and \r\nall the sheltered valley rich and pleasant in the days when the bells rang in that town.” He looked both \r\nsad and grim as he said this: he had been one of Thorin’s companions on the day the Dragon came. \r\n\r\nThey did not dare to follow the river much further towards the Gate; but they went on beyond the \r\nend of the southern spur, until lying hidden behind a rock they could look out and see the dark \r\ncavernous opening in a great cliff -wall between the arms of the Mountain. Out of it the waters of the \r\nRunning River sprang; and out of it too there came a steam and a dark smoke. Nothing moved in the \r\nwaste, save the vapour and the water, and every now and again a black and ominous crow. The only \r\nsound was the sound of the stony water, and every now and again the harsh croak of a bird. Balin \r\nshuddered. \r\n\r\n“Let us return!” he said. “We can do no good here! And I don’t like these dark birds, they look like \r\nspies of evil.” \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Front Gate. \r\n\r\n\r\n“The dragon is still alive and in the halls under the Mountain then — or I imagine so from the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsmoke,” said the hobbit. \r\n\r\n“That does not prove it,” said Balin, “though I don’t doubt you are right. But he might be gone \r\naway some time, or he might be lying out on the mountain-side keeping watch, and still I expect \r\nsmokes and steams would come out of the gates: all the halls within must be filled with his foul reek.” \r\n\r\n\r\nWith such gloomy thoughts, followed ever by croaking crows above them, they made their weary way \r\nback to the camp. Only in June they had been guests in the fair house of Elrond, and though autumn \r\nwas now crawling towards winter that pleasant time now seemed years ago. They were alone in the \r\nperilous waste without hope of further help. They were at the end of their journey, but as far as ever, it \r\nseemed, from the end of their quest. None of them had much spirit left. \r\n\r\nNow strange to say Mr. Baggins had more than the others. He would often borrow Thorin’s map \r\nand gaze at it, pondering over the runes and the message of the moon-letters Elrond had read. It was he \r\nthat made the dwarves begin the dangerous search on the western slopes for the secret door. They \r\nmoved their camp then to a long valley, narrower than the great dale in the South where the Gates of \r\nthe river stood, and walled with lower spurs of the Mountain. Two of these here thrust forward west \r\nfrom the main mass in long steep-sided ridges that fell ever downwards towards the plain. On this \r\nwestern side there were fewer signs of the dragon’s marauding feet, and there was some grass for their \r\nponies. From this western camp, shadowed all day by cliff and wall until the sun began to sink towards \r\nthe forest, day by day they toiled in parties searching for paths up the mountain-side. If the map was \r\ntrue, somewhere high above the cliff at the valley’s head must stand the secret door. Day by day they \r\ncame back to their camp without success. \r\n\r\nBut at last unexpectedly they found what they were seeking. Fili and Kili and the hobbit went back \r\none day down the valley and scrambled among the tumbled rocks at its southern corner. About \r\nmidday, creeping behind a great stone that stood alone like a pillar, Bilbo came on what looked like \r\nrough steps going upwards. Following these excitedly he and the dwarves found traces of a narrow \r\ntrack, often lost, often rediscovered, that wandered on to the top of the southern ridge and brought \r\nthem at last to a still narrower ledge, which turned north across the face of the Mountain. Booking \r\ndown they saw that they were at the top of the cliff at the valley’s head and were gazing down on to \r\ntheir own camp below. Silently, clinging to the rocky wall on their right, they went in single file along \r\nthe ledge, till the wall opened and they turned into a little steep-walled bay, grassy-floored, still and \r\nquiet. Its entrance which they had found could not be seen from below because of the overhang of the \r\ncliff, nor from further off because it was so small that it looked like a dark crack and no more. It was \r\nnot a cave and was open to the sky above; but at its inner end a flat wall rose up that in the lower part, \r\nclose to the ground, was as smooth and upright as masons’ work, but without a joint or crevice to be \r\nseen. No sign was there of post or lintel or threshold, nor any sign of bar or bolt or key-hole; yet they \r\ndid not doubt that they had found the door at last. \r\n\r\nThey beat on it, they thrust and pushed at it, they implored it to move, they spoke fragments of \r\nbroken spells of opening, and nothing stirred. At last tired out they rested on the grass at its feet, and \r\nthen at evening began their long climb down. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere was excitement in the camp that night. In the morning they prepared to move once more. Only \r\nBofur and Bombur were left behind to guard the ponies and such stores as they had brought with them \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom the river. The others went down the valley and up the newly found path, and so to the narrow \r\nledge. Along this they could carry no bundles or packs, so narrow and breathless was it, with a fall of a \r\nhundred and fifty feet beside them on to sharp rocks below; but each of them took a good coil of rope \r\nwound tight about his waist, and so at last without mishap they reached the little grassy bay. \r\n\r\nThere they made their third camp, hauling up what they needed from below with their ropes. Down \r\nthe same way they were able occasionally to lower one of the more active dwarves, such as Kili, to \r\nexchange such news as there was, or to take a share in the guard below, while Bofur was hauled up to \r\nthe higher camp. Bombur would not come up either the rope or the path. \r\n\r\n“I am too fat for such fly-walks,” he said. “I should turn dizzy and tread on my beard, and then you \r\nwould be thirteen again. And the knotted ropes are too slender for my weight.” Luckily for him that \r\nwas not true, as you will see. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile some of them explored the ledge beyond the opening and found a path that led \r\nhigher and higher on to the mountain; but they did not dare to venture very far that way, nor was there \r\nmuch use in it. Out up there a silence reigned, broken by no bird or sound except that of the wind in \r\nthe crannies of stone. They spoke low and never called or sang, for danger brooded in every rock. The \r\nothers who were busy with the secret of the door had no more success. They were too eager to trouble \r\nabout the runes or the moon-letters, but tried without resting to discover where exactly in the smooth \r\nface of the rock the door was hidden. They had brought picks and tools of many sorts from Lake-town, \r\nand at first they tried to use these. But when they struck the stone the handles splintered and jarred \r\ntheir arms cruelly, and the steel heads broke or bent like lead. Mining work, they saw clearly, was no \r\ngood against the magic that had shut this door; and they grew terrified, too, of the echoing noise. \r\n\r\nBilbo found sitting on the doorstep lonesome and wearisome — there was not a doorstep, of course, \r\nreally, but they used to call the little grassy space between the wall and the opening the “doorstep” in \r\nfun, remembering Bilbo’s words long ago at the unexpected party in his hobbit-hole, when he said \r\nthey could sit on the doorstep till they thought of something. And sit and think they did, or wandered \r\naimlessly about, and glummer and glummer they became. \r\n\r\nTheir spirits had risen a little at the discovery of the path, but now they sank into their boots; and \r\nyet they would not give it up and go away. The hobbit was no longer much brighter than the dwarves. \r\nHe would do nothing but sit with his back to the rock-face and stare away west through the opening, \r\nover the cliff, over the wide lands to the black wall of Mirkwood, and to the distances beyond, in \r\nwhich he sometimes thought he could catch glimpses of the Misty Mountains small and far. If the \r\ndwarves asked him what he was doing he answered: \r\n\r\n“You said sitting on the doorstep and thinking would be my job, not to mention getting inside, so I \r\nam sitting and thinking.” But I am afraid he was not thinking much of the job, but of what lay beyond \r\nthe blue distance, the quiet Western Land and the Hill and his hobbit-hole under it. \r\n\r\nA large grey stone lay in the centre of the grass and he stared moodily at it or watched the great \r\nsnails. They seemed to love the little shut-in bay with its walls of cool rock, and there were many of \r\nthem of huge size crawling slowly and stickily along its sides. \r\n\r\n\r\n“Tomorrow begins the last week of autumn,” said Thorin one day. \r\n\r\n“And winter comes after autumn,” said Bifur. “And next year after that,” said Dwalin, “and our \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeards will grow till they hang down the cliff to the valley before anything happens here. What is our \r\nburglar doing for us? Since he has got an invisible ring, and ought to be a specially excellent \r\nperformer now, I am beginning to think he might go through the Front Gate and spy things out a bit!” \r\n\r\nBilbo heard this — the dwarves were on the rocks just above the enclosure where he was sitting — \r\nand “Good Gracious!” he thought, “so that is what they are beginning to think, is it? It is always poor \r\nme that has to get them out of their difficulties, at least since the wizard left. Whatever am I going to \r\ndo? I might have known that something dreadful would happen to me in the end. I don’t think I could \r\nbear to see the unhappy valley of Dale again, and as for that steaming gate! ! !” \r\n\r\nThat night he was very miserable and hardly slept. Next day the dwarves all went wandering off in \r\nvarious directions; some were exercising the ponies down below, some were roving about the \r\nmountain-side. All day Bilbo sat gloomily in the grassy bay gazing at the stone, or out west through \r\nthe narrow opening. He had a queer feeling that he was waiting for something. “Perhaps the wizard \r\nwill suddenly come back today,” he thought. \r\n\r\nIf he lifted his head he could see a glimpse of the distant forest. As the sun turned west there was a \r\ngleam of yellow upon its far roof, as if the light caught the last pale leaves. Soon he saw the orange \r\nball of the sun sinking towards the level of his eyes. He went to the opening and there pale and faint \r\nwas a thin new moon above the rim of Earth. \r\n\r\nAt that very moment he heard a sharp crack behind him. There on the grey stone in the grass was \r\nan enormous thrush, nearly coal black, its pale yellow breast freckled with dark spots. Crack! It had \r\ncaught a snail and was knocking it on the stone. Crack! Crack! \r\n\r\nSuddenly Bilbo understood. Forgetting all danger he stood on the ledge and hailed the dwarves, \r\nshouting and waving. Those that were nearest came tumbling over the rocks and as fast as they could \r\nalong the ledge to him, wondering what on earth was the matter; the others shouted to be hauled up the \r\nropes (except Bombur, of course: he was asleep). \r\n\r\nQuickly Bilbo explained. They all fell silent: the hobbit standing by the grey stone, and the \r\ndwarves with wagging beards watching impatiently. The sun sank lower and lower, and their hopes \r\nfell. It sank into a belt of reddened cloud and disappeared. The dwarves groaned, but still Bilbo stood \r\nalmost without moving. The little moon was dipping to the horizon. Evening was coming on. Then \r\nsuddenly when their hope was lowest a red ray of the sun escaped like a finger through a rent in the \r\ncloud. A gleam of light came straight through the opening into the bay and fell on the smooth rock- \r\nface. The old thrush, who had been watching from a high perch with beady eyes and head cocked on \r\none side, gave a sudden trill. There was a loud crack. A flake of rock split from the wall and fell. A \r\nhole appeared suddenly about three feet from the ground. \r\n\r\nQuickly, trembling lest the chance should fade, the dwarves rushed to the rock and pushed — in \r\nvain. \r\n\r\n“The key! The key!” cried Bilbo. “Where is Thorin?” \r\n\r\nThorin hurried up. \r\n\r\n“The key!” shouted Bilbo. “The key that went with the map! Try it now while there is still time!” \r\n\r\nThen Thorin stepped up and drew the key on its chain from round his neck. He put it to the hole. It \r\nfitted and it turned! Snap! The gleam went out, the sun sank, the moon was gone, and evening sprang \r\ninto the sky. \r\n\r\nNow they all pushed together, and slowly a part of the rock-wall gave way. Long straight cracks \r\nappeared and widened. A door five feet high and three broad was outlined, and slowly without a sound \r\nswung inwards. It seemed as if darkness flowed out like a vapour from the hole in the mountain-side, \r\nand deep darkness in which nothing could be seen lay before their eyes, a yawning mouth leading in \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand down."

    "ChapterData": "For a long time the dwarves stood in the dark before the door and debated, until at last Thorin spoke: \r\n“Now is the time for our esteemed Mr. Baggins, who has proved himself a good companion on our \r\nlong road, and a hobbit full of courage and resource far exceeding his size, and if I may say so \r\npossessed of good luck far exceeding the usual allowance — now is the time for him to perform the \r\nservice for which he was included in our Company; now is the time for him to earn his Reward.” \r\n\r\nYou are familiar with Thorin’ s style on important occasions, so I will not give you any more of it, \r\nthough he went on a good deal longer than this. It certainly was an important occasion, but Bilbo felt \r\nimpatient. By now he was quite familiar with Thorin too, and he knew what he was driving at. \r\n\r\n“If you mean you think it is my job to go into the secret passage first, O Thorin Thrain’s son \r\nOakenshield, may your beard grow ever longer,” he said crossly, “say so at once and have done! I \r\nmight refuse. I have got you out of two messes already, which were hardly in the original bargain, so \r\nthat I am, I think, already owed some reward. But Third time pays for all’ as my father used to say, \r\nand somehow I don’t think I shall refuse. Perhaps I have begun to trust my luck more than I used to in \r\nthe old days” — he meant last spring before he left his own house, but it seemed centuries ago — “but \r\nanyway I think I will go and have a peep at once and get it over. Now who is coming with me?” \r\n\r\nHe did not expect a chorus of volunteers, so he was not disappointed. Fili and Kili looked \r\nuncomfortable and stood on one leg, but the others made no pretence of offering — except old Balin, \r\nthe lookout man, who was rather fond of the hobbit. He said he would come inside at least and perhaps \r\na bit of the way too, ready to call for help if necessary. \r\n\r\nThe most that can be said for the dwarves is this: they intended to pay Bilbo really handsomely for \r\nhis services; they had brought him to do a nasty job for them, and they did not mind the poor little \r\nfellow doing it if he would; but they would all have done their best to get him out of trouble, if he got \r\ninto it, as they did in the case of the trolls at the beginning of their adventures before they had any \r\nparticular reasons for being grateful to him. There it is: dwarves are not heroes, but calculating folk \r\nwith a great idea of the value of money; some are tricky and treacherous and pretty bad lots; some are \r\nnot, but are decent enough people like Thorin and Company, if you don’t expect too much. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe stars were coming out behind him in a pale sky barred with black when the hobbit crept through \r\nthe enchanted door and stole into the Mountain. It was far easier going than he expected. This was no \r\ngoblin entrance, or rough wood-elves’ cave. It was a passage made by dwarves, at the height of their \r\nwealth and skill: straight as a ruler, smooth-floored and smooth-sided, going with a gentle never- \r\nvarying slope direct — to some distant end in the blackness below. \r\n\r\nAfter a while Balin bade Bilbo “Good luck!” and stopped where he could still see the faint outline \r\nof the door, and by a trick of the echoes of the tunnel hear the rustle of the whispering voices of the \r\nothers just outside. Then the hobbit slipped on his ring, and warned by the echoes to take more than \r\nhobbit’s care to make no sound, he crept noiselessly down, down, down into the dark. He was \r\n\r\n\r\ntrembling with fear, but his little face was set and grim. Already he was a very different hobbit from \r\nthe one that had run out without a pocket-handkerchief from Bag-End long ago. He had not had a \r\npocket-handkerchief for ages. He loosened his dagger in its sheath, tightened his belt, and went on. \r\n\r\n\r\n“Now you are in for it at last, Bilbo Baggins,” he said to himself. “You went and put your foot right in \r\nit that night of the party, and now you have got to pull it out and pay for it! Dear me, what a fool I was \r\nand am!” said the least Tookish part of him. “I have absolutely no use for dragon-guarded treasures, \r\nand the whole lot could stay here for ever, if only I could wake up and find this beastly tunnel was my \r\nown front-hall at home ! ” \r\n\r\nHe did not wake up of course, but went still on and on, till all sign of the door behind had faded \r\naway. He was altogether alone. Soon he thought it was beginning to feel warm. “Is that a kind of a \r\nglow I seem to see coming right ahead down there?” he thought. \r\n\r\nIt was. As he went forward it grew and grew, till there was no doubt about it. It was a red light \r\nsteadily getting redder and redder. Also it was now undoubtedly hot in the tunnel. Wisps of vapour \r\nfloated up and past him and he began to sweat. A sound, too, began to throb in his ears, a sort of \r\nbubbling like the noise of a large pot galloping on the fire, mixed with a rumble as of a gigantic tom- \r\ncat purring. This grew to the unmistakable gurgling noise of some vast animal snoring in its sleep \r\ndown there in the red glow in front of him. \r\n\r\nIt was at this point that Bilbo stopped. Going on from there was the bravest thing he ever did. The \r\ntremendous things that happened afterwards were as nothing compared to it. He fought the real battle \r\nin the tunnel alone, before he ever saw the vast danger that lay in wait. At any rate after a short halt go \r\non he did; and you can picture him coming to the end of the tunnel, an opening of much the same size \r\nand shape as the door above. Through it peeps the hobbit’s little head. Before him lies the great \r\nbottom-most cellar or dungeon-hall of the ancient dwarves right at the Mountain’s root. It is almost \r\ndark so that its vastness can only be dimly guessed, but rising from the near side of the rocky floor \r\nthere is a great glow. The glow of Smaug! \r\n\r\n\r\nThere he lay, a vast red-golden dragon, fast asleep; a thrumming came from his jaws and nostrils, and \r\nwisps of smoke, but his fires were low in slumber. Beneath him, under all his limbs and his huge \r\ncoiled tail, and about him on all sides stretching away across the unseen floors, lay countless piles of \r\nprecious things, gold wrought and unwrought, gems and jewels, and silver red-stained in the ruddy \r\nlight. \r\n\r\nSmaug lay, with wings folded like an immeasurable bat, turned partly on one side, so that the \r\nhobbit could see his underparts and his long pale belly crusted with gems and fragments of gold from \r\nhis long lying on his costly bed. Behind him where the walls were nearest could dimly be seen coats of \r\nmail, helms and axes, swords and spears hanging; and there in rows stood great jars and vessels filled \r\nwith a wealth that could not be guessed. \r\n\r\nTo say that Bilbo’s breath was taken away is no description at all. There are no words left to \r\nexpress his staggerment, since Men changed the language that they learned of elves in the days when \r\nall the world was wonderful. Bilbo had heard tell and sing of dragon-hoards before, but the splendour, \r\nthe lust, the glory of such treasure had never yet come home to him. His heart was filled and pierced \r\nwith enchantment and with the desire of dwarves; and he gazed motionless, almost forgetting the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrightful guardian, at the gold beyond price and count. \r\n\r\n\r\nHe gazed for what seemed an age, before drawn almost against his will, he stole from the shadow of \r\nthe doorway, across the floor to the nearest edge of the mounds of treasure. Above him the sleeping \r\ndragon lay, a dire menace even in his sleep. He grasped a great two-handled cup, as heavy as he could \r\ncarry, and cast one fearful eye upwards. Smaug stirred a wing, opened a claw, the rumble of his \r\nsnoring changed its note. \r\n\r\nThen Bilbo fled. But the dragon did not wake — not yet — but shifted into other dreams of greed and \r\nviolence, lying there in his stolen hall while the little hobbit toiled back up the long tunnel. His heart \r\nwas beating and a more fevered shaking was in his legs than when he was going down, but still he \r\nclutched the cup, and his chief thought was: “I’ve done it! This will show them. 'More like a grocer \r\nthan a burglar’ indeed! Well, we’ll hear no more of that.” \r\n\r\nNor did he. Balin was overjoyed to see the hobbit again, and as delighted as he was surprised. He \r\npicked Bilbo up and carried him out into the open air. It was midnight and clouds had covered the \r\nstars, but Bilbo lay with his eyes shut, gasping and taking pleasure in the feel of the fresh air again, \r\nand hardly noticing the excitement of the dwarves, or how they praised him and patted him on the \r\nback and put themselves and all their families for generations to come at his service. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe dwarves were still passing the cup from hand to hand and talking delightedly of the recovery of \r\ntheir treasure, when suddenly a vast rumbling woke in the mountain underneath as if it was an old \r\nvolcano that had made up its mind to start eruptions once again. The door behind them was pulled \r\nnearly to, and blocked from closing with a stone, but up the long tunnel came the dreadful echoes, \r\nfrom far down in the depths, of a bellowing and a trampling that made the ground beneath them \r\ntremble. \r\n\r\nThen the dwarves forgot their joy and their confident boasts of a moment before and cowered down \r\nin fright. Smaug was still to be reckoned with. It does not do to leave a live dragon out of your \r\ncalculations, if you live near him. Dragons may not have much real use for all their wealth, but they \r\nknow it to an ounce as a rule, especially after long possession; and Smaug was no exception. He had \r\npassed from an uneasy dream (in which a warrior, altogether insignificant in size but provided with a \r\nbitter sword and great courage, figured most unpleasantly) to a doze, and from a doze to wide waking. \r\nThere was a breath of strange air in his cave. Could there be a draught from that little hole? He had \r\nnever felt quite happy about it, though it was so small, and now he glared at it in suspicion and \r\nwondered why he had never blocked it up. Of late he had half fancied he had caught the dim echoes of \r\na knocking sound from far above that came down through it to his lair. He stirred and stretched forth \r\nhis neck to sniff. Then he missed the cup! \r\n\r\nThieves! Fire! Murder! Such a thing had not happened since first he came to the Mountain! His \r\nrage passes description — the sort of rage that is only seen when rich folk that have more than they can \r\nenjoy suddenly lose something that they have long had but have never before used or wanted. His fire \r\nbelched forth, the hall smoked, he shook the mountain-roots. He thrust his head in vain at the little \r\nhole, and then coiling his length together, roaring like thunder underground, he sped from his deep lair \r\nthrough its great door, out into the huge passages of the mountain-palace and up towards the Front \r\nGate. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo hunt the whole mountain till he had caught the thief and had torn and trampled him was his one \r\nthought. He issued from the Gate, the waters rose in fierce whistling steam, and up he soared blazing \r\ninto the air and settled on the mountain-top in a spout of green and scarlet flame. The dwarves heard \r\nthe awful rumour of his flight, and they crouched against the walls of the grassy terrace cringing under \r\nboulders, hoping somehow to escape the frightful eyes of the hunting dragon. \r\n\r\nThere they would have all been killed, if it had not been for Bilbo once again. “Quick! Quick!” he \r\ngasped. “The door! The tunnel! It’s no good here.” \r\n\r\nRoused by these words they were just about to creep inside the tunnel when Bifur gave a cry: “My \r\ncousins! Bombur and Bofur — we have forgotten them, they are down in the valley!” \r\n\r\n“They will be slain, and all our ponies too, and all our stores lost,” moaned the others. “We can do \r\nnothing.” \r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” said Thorin, recovering his dignity. “We cannot leave them. Get inside Mr. Baggins \r\nand Balin, and you two Fili and Kili — the dragon shan’t have all of us. Now you others, where are the \r\nropes? Be quick!” \r\n\r\nThose were perhaps the worst moments they had been through yet. The horrible sounds of Smaug’s \r\nanger were echoing in the stony hollows far above; at any moment he might come blazing down or fly \r\nwhirling round and find them there, near the perilous cliff’s edge hauling madly on the ropes. Up \r\ncame Bofur, and still all was safe. Up came Bombur, puffing and blowing while the ropes creaked, and \r\nstill all was safe. Up came some tools and bundles of stores, and then danger was upon them. \r\n\r\nA whirring noise was heard. A red light touched the points of standing rocks. The dragon came. \r\n\r\nThey had barely time to fly back to the tunnel, pulling and dragging in their bundles, when Smaug \r\ncame hurtling from the North, licking the mountain-sides with flame, beating his great wings with a \r\nnoise like a roaring wind. His hot breath shrivelled the grass before the door, and drove in through the \r\ncrack they had left and scorched them as they lay hid. Flickering fires leaped up and black rock- \r\nshadows danced. Then darkness fell as he passed again. The ponies screamed with terror, burst their \r\nropes and galloped wildly off. The dragon swooped and turned to pursue them, and was gone. \r\n\r\n“That’ll be the end of our poor beasts!” said Thorin. “Nothing can escape Smaug once he sees it. \r\nHere we are and here we shall have to stay, unless any one fancies tramping the long open miles back \r\nto the river with Smaug on the watch!” \r\n\r\nIt was not a pleasant thought! They crept further down the tunnel, and there they lay and shivered \r\nthough it was warm and stuffy, until dawn came pale through the crack of the door. Every now and \r\nagain through the night they could hear the roar of the flying dragon grow and then pass and fade, as \r\nhe hunted round and round the mountain-sides. \r\n\r\nHe guessed from the ponies, and from the traces of the camps he had discovered, that men had \r\ncome up from the river and the lake and had scaled the mountain-side from the valley where the \r\nponies had been standing; but the door withstood his searching eye, and the little high-walled bay had \r\nkept out his fiercest flames. Long he had hunted in vain till the dawn chilled his wrath and he went \r\nback to his golden couch to sleep — and to gather new strength. He would not forget or forgive the \r\ntheft, not if a thousand years turned him to smouldering stone, but he could afford to wait. Slow and \r\nsilent he crept back to his lair and half closed his eyes. \r\n\r\nWhen morning came the terror of the dwarves grew less. They realized that dangers of this kind \r\nwere inevitable in dealing with such a guardian, and that it was no good giving up their quest yet. Nor \r\ncould they get away just now, as Thorin had pointed out. Their ponies were lost or killed, and they \r\nwould have to wait some time before Smaug relaxed his watch sufficiently for them to dare the long \r\nway on foot. Luckily they had saved enough of their stores to last them still for some time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey debated long on what was to be done, but they could think of no way of getting rid of Smaug \r\n— which had always been a weak point in their plans, as Bilbo felt inclined to point out. Then as is the \r\nnature of folk that are thoroughly perplexed, they began to grumble at the hobbit, blaming him for \r\nwhat had at first so pleased them: for bringing away a cup and stirring up Smaug’ s wrath so soon. \r\n\r\n“What else do you suppose a burglar is to do?” asked Bilbo angrily. “I was not engaged to kill \r\ndragons, that is warrior’s work, but to steal treasure. I made the best beginning I could. Did you expect \r\nme to trot back with the whole hoard of Thror on my back? If there is any grumbling to be done, I \r\nthink I might have a say. You ought to have brought five hundred burglars not one. I am sure it \r\nreflects great credit on your grandfather, but you cannot pretend that you ever made the vast extent of \r\nhis wealth clear to me. I should want hundreds of years to bring it all up, if I was fifty times as big, \r\nand Smaug as tame as a rabbit.” \r\n\r\nAfter that of course the dwarves begged his pardon. “What then do you propose we should do, Mr. \r\nBaggins?” asked Thorin politely. \r\n\r\n“I have no idea at the moment — if you mean about removing the treasure. That obviously depends \r\nentirely on some new turn of luck and the getting rid of Smaug. Getting rid of dragons is not at all in \r\nmy line, but I will do my best to think about it. Personally I have no hopes at all, and wish I was safe \r\nback at home.” \r\n\r\n“Never mind that for the moment! What are we to do now, to-day?” \r\n\r\n“Well, if you really want my advice, I should say we can do nothing but stay where we are. By day \r\nwe can no doubt creep out safely enough to take the air. Perhaps before long one or two could be \r\nchosen to go back to the store by the river and replenish our supplies. But in the meanwhile everyone \r\nought to be well inside the tunnel by night. \r\n\r\n“Now I will make you an offer. I have got my ring and will creep down this very noon — then if \r\never Smaug ought to be napping — and see what he is up to. Perhaps something will turn up. ‘Every \r\nworm has his weak spot,’ as my father used to say, though I am sure it was not from personal \r\nexperience.” \r\n\r\nNaturally the dwarves accepted the offer eagerly. Already they had come to respect little Bilbo. \r\nNow he had become the real leader in their adventure. He had begun to have ideas and plans of his \r\nown. When midday came he got ready for another j ourney down into the Mountain. He did not like it \r\nof course, but it was not so bad now he knew, more or less, what was in front of him. Had he known \r\nmore about dragons and their wily ways, he might have been more frightened and less hopeful of \r\ncatching this one napping. \r\n\r\nThe sun was shining when he started, but it was as dark as night in the tunnel. The light from the \r\ndoor, almost closed, soon faded as he went down. So silent was his going that smoke on a gentle wind \r\ncould hardly have surpassed it, and he was inclined to feel a bit proud of himself as he drew near the \r\nlower door. There was only the very faintest glow to be seen. \r\n\r\n“Old Smaug is weary and asleep,” he thought. “He can’t see me and he won’t hear me. Cheer up \r\nBilbo!” He had forgotten or had never heard about dragons’ sense of smell. It is also an awkward fact \r\nthat they can keep half an eye open watching while they sleep, if they are suspicious. \r\n\r\nSmaug certainly looked fast asleep, almost dead and dark, with scarcely a snore more than a whiff \r\nof unseen steam, when Bilbo peeped once more from the entrance. He was just about to step out on to \r\nthe floor when he caught a sudden thin and piercing ray of red from under the drooping lid of Smaug’ s \r\nleft eye. He was only pretending to sleep! He was watching the tunnel entrance! Hurriedly Bilbo \r\nstepped back and blessed the luck of his ring. Then Smaug spoke. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well, thief! I smell you and I feel your air. I hear your breath. Come along! Help yourself again, \r\nthere is plenty and to spare!” \r\n\r\nBut Bilbo was not quite so unlearned in dragon-lore as all that, and if Smaug hoped to get him to \r\ncome nearer so easily he was disappointed. “No thank you, O Smaug the Tremendous!” he replied. \r\n\r\n“I did not come for presents. I only wished to have a look at you and see if you were truly as great \r\nas tales say. I did not believe them.” \r\n\r\n“Do you now?” said the dragon somewhat flattered, even though he did not believe a word of it. \r\n\r\n“Truly songs and tales fall utterly short of the reality, O Smaug the Chiefest and Greatest of \r\nCalamities,” replied Bilbo. \r\n\r\n“You have nice manners for a thief and a liar,” said the dragon. “You seem familiar with my name, \r\nbut I don’t seem to remember smelling you before. Who are you and where do you come from, may I \r\nask?” \r\n\r\n“You may indeed! I come from under the hill, and under the hills and over the hills my paths led. \r\nAnd through the air. I am he that walks unseen.” \r\n\r\n“So I can well believe,” said Smaug, “but that is hardly your usual name.” \r\n\r\n“I am the clue-finder, the web-cutter, the stinging fly. I was chosen for the lucky number.” \r\n\r\n“Lovely titles!” sneered the dragon. “But lucky numbers don’t always come off.” \r\n\r\n“I am he that buries his friends alive and drowns them and draws them alive again from the water. I \r\ncame from the end of a bag, but no bag went over me.” \r\n\r\n“These don’t sound so creditable,” scoffed Smaug. “I am the friend of bears and the guest of \r\neagles. I am Ringwinner and Luckwearer; and I am Barrel-rider,” went on Bilbo beginning to be \r\npleased with his riddling. \r\n\r\n“That’s better!” said Smaug. “But don’t let your imagination run away with you!” \r\n\r\n\r\nThis of course is the way to talk to dragons, if you don’t want to reveal your proper name (which is \r\nwise), and don’t want to infuriate them by a flat refusal (which is also very wise). No dragon can resist \r\nthe fascination of riddling talk and of wasting time trying to understand it. There was a lot here which \r\nSmaug did not understand at all (though I expect you do, since you know all about Bilbo’s adventures \r\nto which he was referring), but he thought he understood enough, and he chuckled in his wicked \r\ninside. \r\n\r\n“I thought so last night,” he smiled to himself. “Lake-men, some nasty scheme of those miserable \r\ntub-trading Lake-men, or I’m a lizard. I haven’t been down that way for an age and an age; but I will \r\nsoon alter that!” \r\n\r\n“Very well, O Barrel-rider!” he said aloud. “Maybe Barrel was your pony’s name; and maybe not, \r\nthough it was fat enough. You may walk unseen, but you did not walk all the way. Let me tell you I ate \r\nsix ponies last night and I shall catch and eat all the others before long. In return for the excellent \r\nmeal I will give you one piece of advice for your good: don’t have more to do with dwarves than you \r\ncan help!” \r\n\r\n“Dwarves!” said Bilbo in pretended surprise. “Don’t talk to me!” said Smaug. “I know the smell \r\n(and taste) of dwarf — no one better. Don’t tell me that I can eat a dwarf-ridden pony and not know it! \r\nYou’ll come to a bad end, if you go with such friends, Thief Barrel-rider. I don’t mind if you go back \r\nand tell them so from me.” But he did not tell Bilbo that there was one smell he could not make out at \r\nall, hobbit-smell; it was quite outside his experience and puzzled him mightily. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I suppose you got a fair price for that cup last night?” he went on. “Come now, did you? Nothing \r\nat all! Well, that’s just like them. And I suppose they are skulking outside, and your job is to do all the \r\ndangerous work and get what you can when I’m not looking — for them? And you will get a fair share? \r\nDon’t you believe it! If you get off alive, you will be lucky.” \r\n\r\n\r\nBilbo was now beginning to feel really uncomfortable. Whenever Smaug’s roving eye, seeking for \r\nhim in the shadows, flashed across him, he trembled, and an unaccountable desire seized hold of him \r\nto rush out and reveal himself and tell all the truth to Smaug. In fact he was in grievous danger of \r\ncoming under the dragon-spell. But plucking up courage he spoke again. \r\n\r\n“You don’t know everything, O Smaug the Mighty,” said he. “Not gold alone brought us hither.” \r\n\r\n“Ha! Ha! You admit the 'us’” laughed Smaug. “Why not say 'us fourteen’ and be done with it, Mr. \r\nLucky Number? I am pleased to hear that you had other business in these parts besides my gold. In \r\nthat case you may, perhaps, not altogether waste your time. \r\n\r\n“I don’t know if it has occurred to you that, even if you could steal the gold bit by bit — a matter of \r\na hundred years or so — you could not get it very far? Not much use on the mountain-side? Not much \r\nuse in the forest? Bless me! Had you never thought of the catch? A fourteenth share, I suppose, or \r\nsomething like it, those were the terms, eh? But what about delivery? What about cartage? What about \r\narmed guards and tolls?” And Smaug laughed aloud. He had a wicked and a wily heart, and he knew \r\nhis guesses were not far out, though he suspected that the Lake-men were at the back of the plans, and \r\nthat most of the plunder was meant to stop there in the town by the shore that in his young days had \r\nbeen called Esgaroth. \r\n\r\nYou will hardly believe it, but poor Bilbo was really very taken aback. So far all his thoughts and \r\nenergies had been concentrated on getting to the Mountain and finding the entrance. He had never \r\nbothered to wonder how the treasure was to be removed, certainly never how any part of it that might \r\nfall to his share was to be brought back all the way to Bag-End Under-Hill. \r\n\r\nNow a nasty suspicion began to grow in his mind — had the dwarves forgotten this important point \r\ntoo, or were they laughing in their sleeves at him all the time? That is the effect that dragon-talk has \r\non the inexperienced. Bilbo of course ought to have been on his guard; but Smaug had rather an \r\noverwhelming personality. \r\n\r\n“I tell you,” he said, in an effort to remain loyal to his friends and to keep his end up, “that gold \r\nwas only an afterthought with us. We came over hill and under hill, by wave and wind, for Revenge. \r\nSurely, O Smaug the unassessably wealthy, you must realize that your success has made you some \r\nbitter enemies?” \r\n\r\nThen Smaug really did laugh — a devastating sound which shook Bilbo to the floor, while far up in \r\nthe tunnel the dwarves huddled together and imagined that the hobbit had come to a sudden and a \r\nnasty end. \r\n\r\n“Revenge!” he snorted, and the light of his eyes lit the hall from floor to ceiling like scarlet \r\nlightning. “Revenge! The King under the Mountain is dead and where are his kin that dare seek \r\nrevenge? Girion Lord of Dale is dead, and I have eaten his people like a wolf among sheep, and where \r\nare his sons’ sons that dare approach me? I kill where I wish and none dare resist. I laid low the \r\nwarriors of old and their like is not in the world today. Then I was but young and tender. Now I am old \r\nand strong, strong, strong, Thief in the Shadows!” he gloated. “My armour is like tenfold shields, my \r\nteeth are swords, my claws spears, the shock of my tail a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane, and my \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbreath death!” \r\n\r\n\r\n“I have always understood,” said Bilbo in a frightened squeak, “that dragons were softer \r\nunderneath, especially in the region of the — er — chest; but doubtless one so fortified has thought of \r\nthat.” \r\n\r\nThe dragon stopped short in his boasting. “Your information is antiquated,” he snapped. “I am \r\narmoured above and below with iron scales and hard gems. No blade can pierce me.” \r\n\r\n“I might have guessed it,” said Bilbo. “Truly there can nowhere be found the equal of Lord Smaug \r\nthe Impenetrable. What magnificence to possess a waistcoat of fine diamonds!” \r\n\r\n“Yes, it is rare and wonderful, indeed,” said Smaug absurdly pleased. He did not know that the \r\nhobbit had already caught a glimpse of his peculiar under-covering on his previous visit, and was \r\nitching for a closer view for reasons of his own. The dragon rolled over. “Look!” he said. “What do \r\nyou say to that?” \r\n\r\n“Dazzlingly marvellous! Perfect! Flawless! Staggering!” exclaimed Bilbo aloud, but what he \r\nthought inside was: “Old fool! Why, there is a large patch in the hollow of his left breast as bare as a \r\nsnail out of its shell!” \r\n\r\nAfter he had seen that Mr. Baggins’ one idea was to get away. “Well, I really must not detain Your \r\nMagnificence any longer,” he said, “or keep you from much needed rest. Ponies take some catching, I \r\nbelieve, after a long start. And so do burglars,” he added as a parting shot, as he darted back and fled \r\nup the tunnel. \r\n\r\nIt was an unfortunate remark, for the dragon spouted terrific flames after him, and fast though he \r\nsped up the slope, he had not gone nearly far enough to be comfortable before the ghastly head of \r\nSmaug was thrust against the opening behind. Luckily the whole head and jaws could not squeeze in, \r\nbut the nostrils sent forth fire and vapour to pursue him, and he was nearly overcome, and stumbled \r\nblindly on in great pain and fear. He had been feeling rather pleased with the cleverness of his \r\nconversation with Smaug, but his mistake at the end shook him into better sense. \r\n\r\n“Never laugh at live dragons, Bilbo you fool!” he said to himself, and it became a favourite saying \r\nof his later, and passed into a proverb. “You aren’t nearly through this adventure yet,” he added, and \r\nthat was pretty true as well. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was turning into evening when he came out again and stumbled and fell in a faint on the \r\n‘doorstep’. The dwarves revived him, and doctored his scorches as well as they could; but it was a \r\nlong time before the hair on the back of his head and his heels grew properly again: it had all been \r\nsinged and frizzled right down to the skin. In the meanwhile his friends did their best to cheer him up; \r\nand they were eager for his story, especially wanting to know why the dragon had made such an awful \r\nnoise, and how Bilbo had escaped. \r\n\r\nBut the hobbit was worried and uncomfortable, and they had difficulty in getting anything out of \r\nhim. On thinking things over he was now regretting some of the things he had said to the dragon, and \r\nwas not eager to repeat them. The old thrush was sitting on a rock near by with his head cocked on one \r\nside, listening to all that was said. It shows what an ill temper Bilbo was in: he picked up a stone and \r\nthrew it at the thrush, which merely fluttered aside and came back. \r\n\r\n“Drat the bird!” said Bilbo crossly. “I believe he is listening, and I don’t like the look of him.” \r\n\r\n“Leave him alone!” said Thorin. “The thrushes are good and friendly — this is a very old bird \r\nindeed, and is maybe the last left of the ancient breed that used to live about here, tame to the hands of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmy father and grandfather. They were a long-lived and magical race, and this might even be one of \r\nthose that were alive then, a couple of hundreds of years or more ago. The Men of Dale used to have \r\nthe trick of understanding their language, and used them for messengers to fly to the Men of the Lake \r\nand elsewhere.” \r\n\r\n“Well, he’ll have news to take to Lake-town all right, if that is what he is after,” said Bilbo; \r\n\r\n“though I don’t suppose there are any people left there that trouble with thrush-language.” \r\n\r\n“Why what has happened?” cried the dwarves. “Do get on with your tale!” \r\n\r\nSo Bilbo told them all he could remember, and he confessed that he had a nasty feeling that the \r\ndragon guessed too much from his riddles added to the camps and the ponies. “I am sure he knows we \r\ncame from Lake-town and had help from there; and I have a horrible feeling that his next move may \r\nbe in that direction. I wish to goodness I had never said that about Barrel-rider; it would make even a \r\nblind rabbit in these parts think of the Lake-men.” \r\n\r\n“Well, well! It cannot be helped, and it is difficult not to slip in talking to a dragon, or so I have \r\nalways heard,” said Balin anxious to comfort him. “I think you did very well, if you ask me — you \r\nfound out one very useful thing at any rate, and got home alive, and that is more than most can say \r\nwho have had words with the likes of Smaug. It may be a mercy and a blessing yet to know of the bare \r\npatch in the old Worm’s diamond waistcoat.” \r\n\r\nThat turned the conversation, and they all began discussing dragon-slayings historical, dubious, \r\nand mythical, and the various sorts of stabs and jabs and undercuts, and the different arts devices and \r\nstratagems by which they had been accomplished. The general opinion was that catching a dragon \r\nnapping was not as easy as it sounded, and the attempt to stick one or prod one asleep was more likely \r\nto end in disaster than a bold frontal attack. All the while they talked the thrush listened, till at last \r\nwhen the stars began to peep forth, it silently spread its wings and flew away. And all the while they \r\ntalked and the shadows lengthened Bilbo became more and more unhappy and his foreboding grew. \r\n\r\nAt last he interrupted them. “I am sure we are very unsafe here,” he said, “and I don’t see the point \r\nof sitting here. The dragon has withered all the pleasant green, and anyway the night has come and it is \r\ncold. But I feel it in my bones that this place will be attacked again. Smaug knows now how I came \r\ndown to his hall, and you can trust him to guess where the other end of the tunnel is. He will break all \r\nthis side of the Mountain to bits, if necessary, to stop up our entrance, and if we are smashed with it \r\nthe better he will like it.” \r\n\r\n“You are very gloomy, Mr. Baggins!” said Thorin. “Why has not Smaug blocked the lower end, \r\nthen, if he is so eager to keep us out? He has not, or we should have heard him.” \r\n\r\n“I don’t know, I don’t know — because at first he wanted to try and lure me in again, I suppose, and \r\nnow perhaps because he is waiting till after tonight’s hunt, or because he does not want to damage his \r\nbedroom if he can help it — but I wish you would not argue. Smaug will be coming out at any minute \r\nnow, and our only hope is to get well in the tunnel and shut the door.” \r\n\r\nHe seemed so much in earnest that the dwarves at last did as he said, though they delayed shutting \r\nthe door — it seemed a desperate plan, for no one knew whether or how they could get it open again \r\nfrom the inside, and the thought of being shut in a place from which the only way out led through the \r\ndragon’s lair was not one they liked. Also everything seemed quite quiet, both outside and down the \r\ntunnel. So for a longish while they sat inside not far down from the half-open door and went on \r\ntalking. \r\n\r\nThe talk turned to the dragon’s wicked words about the dwarves. Bilbo wished he had never heard \r\nthem, or at least that he could feel quite certain that the dwarves now were absolutely honest when \r\nthey declared that they had never thought at all about what would happen after the treasure had been \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwon. “We knew it would be a desperate venture,” said Thorin, “and we know that still; and I still think \r\nthat when we have won it will be time enough to think what to do about it. As for your share, Mr. \r\nBaggins, I assure you we are more than grateful and you shall choose your own fourteenth, as soon as \r\nwe have anything to divide. I am sorry if you are worried about transport, and I admit the difficulties \r\nare great — the lands have not become less wild with the passing of time, rather the reverse — but we \r\nwill do whatever we can for you, and take our share of the cost when the time comes. Believe me or \r\nnot as you like!” \r\n\r\nFrom that the talk turned to the great hoard itself and to the things that Thorin and Balin \r\nremembered. They wondered if they were still lying there unharmed in the hall below: the spears that \r\nwere made for the armies of the great King Bladorthin (long since dead), each had a thrice-forged \r\nhead and their shafts were inlaid with cunning gold, but they were never delivered or paid for; shields \r\nmade for warriors long dead; the great golden cup of Thror, two-handed, hammered and carven with \r\nbirds and flowers whose eyes and petals were of jewels; coats of mail gilded and silvered and \r\nimpenetrable; the necklace of Girion, Lord of Dale, made of five hundred emeralds green as grass, \r\nwhich he gave for the arming of his eldest son in a coat of dwarf-linked rings the like of which had \r\nnever been made before, for it was wrought of pure silver to the power and strength of triple steel. But \r\nfairest of all was the great white gem, which the dwarves had found beneath the roots of the Mountain, \r\nthe Heart of the Mountain, the Arkenstone of Thrain. \r\n\r\n“The Arkenstone! The Arkenstone!” murmured Thorin in the dark, half dreaming with his chin \r\nupon his knees. “It was like a globe with a thousand facets; it shone like silver in the firelight, like \r\nwater in the sun, like snow under the stars, like rain upon the Moon!” \r\n\r\nBut the enchanted desire of the hoard had fallen from Bilbo. All through their talk he was only half \r\nlistening to them. He sat nearest to the door with one ear cocked for any beginnings of a sound \r\nwithout, his other was alert for echoes beyond the murmurs of the dwarves, for any whisper of a \r\nmovement from far below. \r\n\r\nDarkness grew deeper and he grew ever more uneasy. “Shut the door!” he begged them, “I fear that \r\ndragon in my marrow. I like this silence far less than the uproar of last night. Shut the door before it is \r\ntoo late!” \r\n\r\nSomething in his voice gave the dwarves an uncomfortable feeling. Slowly Thorin shook off his \r\ndreams and getting up he kicked away the stone that wedged the door. Then they thrust upon it, and it \r\nclosed with a snap and a clang. No trace of a keyhole was there left on the inside. They were shut in \r\nthe Mountain! \r\n\r\nAnd not a moment too soon. They had hardly gone any distance down the tunnel when a blow \r\nsmote the side of the Mountain like the crash of battering-rams made of forest oaks and swung by \r\ngiants. The rock boomed, the walls cracked and stones fell from the roof on their heads. What would \r\nhave happened if the door had still been open I don’t like to think. They fled further down the tunnel \r\nglad to be still alive, while behind them outside they heard the roar and rumble of Smaug’s fury. He \r\nwas breaking rocks to pieces, smashing wall and cliff with the lashings of his huge tail, till their little \r\nlofty camping ground, the scorched grass, the thrush’s stone, the snail-covered walls, the narrow \r\nledge, and all disappeared in a jumble of smithereens, and an avalanche of splintered stones fell over \r\nthe cliff into the valley below. \r\n\r\nSmaug had left his lair in silent stealth, quietly soared into the air, and then floated heavy and slow \r\nin the dark like a monstrous crow, down the wind towards the west of the Mountain, in the hopes of \r\ncatching unawares something or somebody there, and of spying the outlet to the passage which the \r\nthief had used. This was the outburst of his wrath when he could find nobody and see nothing, even \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere he guessed the outlet must actually be. \r\n\r\nAfter he had let off his rage in this way he felt better and he thought in his heart that he would not \r\nbe troubled again from that direction. In the meanwhile he had further vengeance to take. “Barrel- \r\nrider!” he snorted. “Your feet came from the waterside and up the water you came without a doubt. I \r\ndon’t know your smell, but if you are not one of those men of the Lake, you had their help. They shall \r\nsee me and remember who is the real King under the Mountain!” \r\n\r\nHe rose in fire and went away south towards the Running River."

    "ChapterName": " NOT AT HOME ",
    "ChapterData": "In the meanwhile, the dwarves sat in darkness, and utter silence fell about them. Little they ate and \r\nlittle they spoke. They could not count the passing of time; and they scarcely dared to move, for the \r\nwhisper of their voices echoed and rustled in the tunnel. If they dozed, they woke still to darkness and \r\nto silence going on unbroken. At last after days and days of waiting, as it seemed, when they were \r\nbecoming choked and dazed for want of air, they could bear it no longer. They would almost have \r\nwelcomed sounds from below of the dragon’s return. In the silence they feared some cunning devilry \r\nof his, but they could not sit there for ever. \r\n\r\nThorin spoke: “Let us try the door!” he said. “I must feel the wind on my face soon or die. I think I \r\nwould rather be smashed by Smaug in the open than suffocate in here!” So several of the dwarves got \r\nup and groped back to where the door had been. But they found that the upper end of the tunnel had \r\nbeen shattered and blocked with broken rock. Neither key nor the magic it had once obeyed would \r\never open that door again. \r\n\r\n“We are trapped!” they groaned. “This is the end. We shall die here.” \r\n\r\nBut somehow, just when the dwarves were most despairing, Bilbo felt a strange lightening of the \r\nheart, as if a heavy weight had gone from under his waistcoat. \r\n\r\n“Come, come!” he said. “‘While there’s life there’s hope!’ as my father used to say, and ‘Third \r\ntime pays for all.’ I am going down the tunnel once again. I have been that way twice, when I knew \r\nthere was a dragon at the other end, so I will risk a third visit when I am no longer sure. Anyway the \r\nonly way out is down. And I think this time you had better all come with me.” \r\n\r\nIn desperation they agreed, and Thorin was the first to go forward by Bilbo’s side. \r\n\r\n“Now do be careful!” whispered the hobbit, “and as quiet as you can be! There may be no Smaug at \r\nthe bottom, but then again there may be. Don’t let us take any unnecessary risks!” \r\n\r\nDown, down they went. The dwarves could not, of course, compare with the hobbit in real stealth, \r\nand they made a deal of puffing and shuffling which echoes magnified alarmingly; but though every \r\nnow and again Bilbo in fear stopped and listened, not a sound stirred below. Near the bottom, as well \r\nas he could judge, Bilbo slipped on his ring and went ahead. But he did not need it: the darkness was \r\ncomplete, and they were all invisible, ring or no ring. In fact so black was it that the hobbit came to \r\nthe opening unexpectedly, put his hand on air, stumbled forward, and rolled headlong into the hall! \r\n\r\nThere he lay face downwards on the floor and did not dare to get up, or hardly even to breathe. But \r\nnothing moved. There was not a gleam of light — unless, as it seemed to him, when at last he slowly \r\nraised his head, there was a pale white glint, above him and far off in the gloom. But certainly it was \r\nnot a spark of dragon-fire, though the worm-stench was heavy in the place, and the taste of vapour was \r\non his tongue. \r\n\r\nAt length Mr. Baggins could bear it no longer. “Confound you, Smaug, you worm!” he squeaked \r\naloud. “Stop playing hide-and-seek! Give me a light, and then eat me, if you can catch me!” \r\n\r\nFaint echoes ran round the unseen hall, but there was no answer. \r\n\r\nBilbo got up, and found that he did not know in what direction to turn. \r\n\r\n\r\n“Now I wonder what on earth Smaug is playing at,” he said. “He is not at home today (or tonight, \r\nor whatever it is), I do believe. If Oin and Gloin have not lost their tinder-boxes, perhaps we can make \r\na little light, and have a look round before the luck turns.” \r\n\r\n“Light!” he cried. “Can anybody make a light?” \r\n\r\n\r\nThe dwarves, of course, were very alarmed when Bilbo fell forward down the step with a bump into \r\nthe hall, and they sat huddled just where he had left them at the end of the tunnel. \r\n\r\n“Sh! sh!” they hissed, when they heard his voice; and though that helped the hobbit to find out \r\nwhere they were, it was some time before he could get anything else out of them. But in the end, when \r\nBilbo actually began to stamp on the floor, and screamed out “light!” at the top of his shrill voice, \r\nThorin gave way, and Oin and Gloin were sent back to their bundles at the top of the tunnel. \r\n\r\nAfter a while a twinkling gleam showed them returning, Oin with a small pine-torch alight in his \r\nhand, and Gloin with a bundle of others under his arm. Quickly Bilbo trotted to the door and took the \r\ntorch; but he could not persuade the dwarves to light the others or to come and join him yet. As Thorin \r\ncarefully explained, Mr. Baggins was still officially their expert burglar and investigator. If he liked to \r\nrisk a light, that was his affair. They would wait in the tunnel for his report. So they sat near the door \r\nand watched. \r\n\r\nThey saw the little dark shape of the hobbit start across the floor holding his tiny light aloft. Every \r\nnow and again, while he was still near enough, they caught a glint and a tinkle as he stumbled on some \r\ngolden thing. The light grew smaller as he wandered away into the vast hall; then it began to rise \r\ndancing into the air. Bilbo was climbing the great mound of treasure. Soon he stood upon the top, and \r\nstill went on. Then they saw him halt and stoop for a moment; but they did not know the reason. \r\n\r\nIt was the Arkenstone, the Heart of the Mountain. So Bilbo guessed from Thorin’ s description; but \r\nindeed there could not be two such gems, even in so marvellous a hoard, even in all the world. Ever as \r\nhe climbed, the same white gleam had shone before him and drawn his feet towards it. Slowly it grew \r\nto a little globe of pallid light. Now as he came near, it was tinged with a flickering sparkle of many \r\ncolours at the surface, reflected and splintered from the wavering light of his torch. At last he looked \r\ndown upon it, and he caught his breath. The great jewel shone before his feet of its own inner light, \r\nand yet, cut and fashioned by the dwarves, who had dug it from the heart of the mountain long ago, it \r\ntook all light that fell upon it and changed it into ten thousand sparks of white radiance shot with \r\nglints of the rainbow. \r\n\r\nSuddenly Bilbo’s arm went towards it drawn by its enchantment. His small hand would not close \r\nabout it, for it was a large and heavy gem; but he lifted it, shut his eyes, and put it in his deepest \r\npocket. \r\n\r\n“Now I am a burglar indeed!” thought he. “But I suppose I must tell the dwarves about it — some \r\ntime. They did say I could pick and choose my own share; and I think I would choose this, if they took \r\nall the rest!” All the same he had an uncomfortable feeling that the picking and choosing had not \r\nreally been meant to include this marvellous gem, and that trouble would yet come of it. \r\n\r\nNow he went on again. Down the other side of the great mound he climbed, and the spark of his \r\ntorch vanished from the sight of the watching dwarves. But soon they saw it far away in the distance \r\nagain. Bilbo was crossing the floor of the hall. \r\n\r\nHe went on, until he came to the great doors at the further side, and there a draught of air refreshed \r\nhim, but it almost puffed out his light. He peeped timidly through, and caught a glimpse of great \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npassages and of the dim beginnings of wide stairs going up into the gloom. And still there was no sight \r\nnor sound of Smaug. He was just going to turn and go back, when a black shape swooped at him, and \r\nbrushed his face. He squeaked and started, stumbled backwards and fell. His torch dropped head \r\ndownwards and went out! \r\n\r\n“Only a bat, I suppose and hope!” he said miserably. “But now what am I to do? Which is East, \r\nSouth, North, or West?” \r\n\r\n“Thorin! Balin! Oin! Gloin! Fili! Kili!” he cried as loud as he could — it seemed a thin little noise \r\nin the wide blackness. “The light’s gone out! Someone come and find me and help me!” For the \r\nmoment his courage had failed altogether. \r\n\r\nFaintly the dwarves heard his small cries, though the only word they could catch was “help!” \r\n\r\n“Now what on earth or under it has happened?” said Thorin. “Certainly not the dragon, or he would \r\nnot go on squeaking.” \r\n\r\nThey waited a moment or two, and still there were no dragon-noises, no sound at all in fact but \r\nBilbo’s distant voice. “Come, one of you, get another light or two!” Thorin ordered. “It seems we have \r\ngot to go and help our burglar.” \r\n\r\n“It is about our turn to help,” said Balin, “and I am quite willing to go. Anyway I expect it is safe \r\nfor the moment.” \r\n\r\nGloin lit several more torches, and then they all crept out, one by one, and went along the wall as \r\nhurriedly as they could. It was not long before they met Bilbo himself coming back towards them. His \r\nwits had quickly returned as soon as he saw the twinkle of their lights. \r\n\r\n“Only a bat and a dropped torch, nothing worse!” he said in answer to their questions. Though they \r\nwere much relieved, they were inclined to be grumpy at being frightened for nothing; but what they \r\nwould have said, if he had told them at that moment about the Arkenstone, I don’t know. The mere \r\nfleeting glimpses of treasure which they had caught as they went along had rekindled all the fire of \r\ntheir dwarvish hearts; and when the heart of a dwarf, even the most respectable, is wakened by gold \r\nand by jewels, he grows suddenly bold, and he may become fierce. \r\n\r\nThe dwarves indeed no longer needed any urging. All were now eager to explore the hall while they \r\nhad the chance, and willing to believe that, for the present, Smaug was away from home. Each now \r\ngripped a lighted torch; and as they gazed, first on one side and then on another, they forgot fear and \r\neven caution. They spoke aloud, and cried out to one another, as they lifted old treasures from the \r\nmound or from the wall and held them in the light, caressing and fingering them. \r\n\r\nFili and Kili were almost in merry mood, and finding still hanging there many golden harps strung \r\nwith silver they took them and struck them; and being magical (and also untouched by the dragon, \r\nwho had small interest in music) they were still in tune. The dark hall was filled with a melody that \r\nhad long been silent. But most of the dwarves were more practical: they gathered gems and stuffed \r\ntheir pockets, and let what they could not carry fall back through their fingers with a sigh. Thorin was \r\nnot least among these; but always he searched from side to side for something which he could not \r\nfind. It was the Arkenstone; but he spoke of it yet to no one. \r\n\r\nNow the dwarves took down mail and weapons from the walls, and armed themselves. Royal \r\nindeed did Thorin look, clad in a coat of gold-plated rings, with a silver-hafted axe in a belt crusted \r\nwith scarlet stones. \r\n\r\n“Mr. Baggins!” he cried. “Here is the first payment of your reward! Cast off your old coat and put \r\non this!” \r\n\r\nWith that he put on Bilbo a small coat of mail, wrought for some young elf-prince long ago. It was \r\nof silver-steel, which the elves call mithril, and with it went a belt of pearls and crystals. A light helm \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof figured leather, strengthened beneath with hoops of steel, and studded about the brim with white \r\ngems, was set upon the hobbit’s head. \r\n\r\n“I feel magnificent,” he thought; “but I expect I look rather absurd. How they would laugh on the \r\nHill at home! Still I wish there was a looking-glass handy!” \r\n\r\nAll the same Mr. Baggins kept his head more clear of the bewitchment of the hoard than the \r\ndwarves did. Long before the dwarves were tired of examining the treasures, he became weary of it \r\nand sat down on the floor; and he began to wonder nervously what the end of it all would be. “I would \r\ngive a good many of these precious goblets,” he thought, “for a drink of something cheering out of one \r\nof Beorn’s wooden bowls!” \r\n\r\n“Thorin!” he cried aloud. “What next? We are armed, but what good has any armour ever been \r\nbefore against Smaug the Dreadful? This treasure is not yet won back. We are not looking for gold yet, \r\nbut for a way of escape; and we have tempted luck too long!” \r\n\r\n“You speak the truth!” answered Thorin, recovering his wits. “Let us go! I will guide you. Not in a \r\nthousand years should I forget the ways of this palace.” Then he hailed the others, and they gathered \r\ntogether, and holding their torches above their heads they passed through the gaping doors, not \r\nwithout many a backward glance of longing. \r\n\r\nTheir glittering mail they had covered again with their old cloaks and their bright helms with their \r\ntattered hoods, and one by one they walked behind Thorin, a line of little lights in the darkness that \r\nhalted often, listening in fear once more for any rumour of the dragon’s coming. \r\n\r\nThough all the old adornments were long mouldered or destroyed, and though all was befouled and \r\nblasted with the comings and goings of the monster, Thorin knew every passage and every turn. They \r\nclimbed long stairs, and turned and went down wide echoing ways, and turned again and climbed yet \r\nmore stairs, and yet more stairs again. These were smooth, cut out of the living rock broad and fair; \r\nand up, up, the dwarves went, and they met no sign of any living thing, only furtive shadows that fled \r\nfrom the approach of their torches fluttering in the draughts. \r\n\r\nThe steps were not made, all the same, for hobbit-legs, and Bilbo was just feeling that he could go \r\non no longer, when suddenly the roof sprang high and far beyond the reach of their torch-light. A \r\nwhite glimmer could be seen coming through some opening far above, and the air smelt sweeter. \r\nBefore them light came dimly through great doors, that hung twisted on their hinges and half burnt. \r\n\r\n“This is the great chamber of Thror,” said Thorin; “the hall of feasting and of council. Not far off \r\nnow is the Front Gate.” \r\n\r\nThey passed through the ruined chamber. Tables were rotting there; chairs and benches were lying \r\nthere overturned, charred and decaying. Skulls and bones were upon the floor among flagons and \r\nbowls and broken drinking-horns and dust. As they came through yet more doors at the further end, a \r\nsound of water fell upon their ears, and the grey light grew suddenly more full. \r\n\r\n“There is the birth of the Running River,” said Thorin. “From here it hastens to the Gate. Let us \r\nfollow it!” \r\n\r\nOut of a dark opening in a wall of rock there issued a boiling water, and it flowed swirling in a \r\nnarrow channel, carved and made straight and deep by the cunning of ancient hands. Beside it ran a \r\nstone-paved road, wide enough for many men abreast. Swiftly along this they ran, and round a wide- \r\nsweeping turn — and behold! before them stood the broad light of day. In front there rose a tall arch, \r\nstill showing the fragments of old carven work within, worn and splintered and blackened though it \r\nwas. A misty sun sent its pale light between the arms of the Mountain, and beams of gold fell on the \r\npavement at the threshold. \r\n\r\nA whirl of bats frightened from slumber by their smoking torches flurried over them; as they \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsprang forward their feet slithered on stones rubbed smooth and slimed by the passing of the dragon. \r\nNow before them the water fell noisily outward and foamed down towards the valley. They flung their \r\npale torches to the ground, and stood gazing out with dazzled eyes. They were come to the Front Gate, \r\nand were looking out upon Dale. \r\n\r\n“Well!” said Bilbo, “I never expected to be looking out of this door. And I never expected to be so \r\npleased to see the sun again, and to feel the wind on my face. But, ow! this wind is cold!” \r\n\r\nIt was. A bitter easterly breeze blew with a threat of oncoming winter. It swirled over and round the \r\narms of the Mountain into the valley, and sighed among the rocks. After their long time in the stewing \r\ndepths of the dragon-haunted caverns, they shivered in the sun. \r\n\r\nSuddenly Bilbo realized that he was not only tired but also very hungry indeed. “It seems to be late \r\nmorning,” he said, “and so I suppose it is more or less breakfast-time — if there is any breakfast to \r\nhave. But I don’t feel that Smaug’s front doorstep is the safest place for a meal. Do let’s go \r\nsomewhere where we can sit quiet for a bit!” \r\n\r\n“Quite right!” said Balin. “And I think I know which way we should go: we ought to make for the \r\nold look-out post at the South-West corner of the Mountain.” \r\n\r\n“How far is that?” asked the hobbit. \r\n\r\n“Five hours march, I should think. It will be rough going. The road from the Gate along the left \r\nedge of the stream seems all broken up. But look down there! The river loops suddenly east across \r\nDale in front of the ruined town. At that point there was once a bridge, leading to steep stairs that \r\nclimbed up the right bank, and so to a road running towards Ravenhill. There is (or was) a path that \r\nleft the road and climbed up to the post. A hard climb, too, even if the old steps are still there.” \r\n\r\n“Dear me!” grumbled the hobbit. “More walking and more climbing without breakfast! I wonder \r\nhow many breakfasts, and other meals, we have missed inside that nasty clockless, timeless hole?” \r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact two nights and the day between had gone by (and not altogether without food) \r\nsince the dragon smashed the magic door, but Bilbo had quite lost count, and it might have been one \r\nnight or a week of nights for all he could tell. \r\n\r\n“Come, come!” said Thorin laughing — his spirits had begun to rise again, and he rattled the \r\nprecious stones in his pockets. “Don’t call my palace a nasty hole! You wait till it has been cleaned \r\nand redecorated!” \r\n\r\n“That won’t be till Smaug’s dead,” said Bilbo glumly. “In the meanwhile where is he? I would give \r\na good breakfast to know. I hope he is not up on the Mountain looking down at us!” \r\n\r\nThat idea disturbed the dwarves mightily, and they quickly decided that Bilbo and Balin were right. \r\n“We must move away from here,” said Dori. “I feel as if his eyes were on the back of my head.” \r\n“It’s a cold lonesome place,” said Bombur. “There may be drink, but I see no sign of food. A \r\ndragon would always be hungry in such parts.” \r\n\r\n“Come on! Come on!” cried the others. “Let us follow Balin’ s path!” \r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the rocky wall to the right there was no path, so on they trudged among the stones on the left \r\nside of the river, and the emptiness and desolation soon sobered even Thorin again. The bridge that \r\nBalin had spoken of they found long fallen, and most of its stones were now only boulders in the \r\nshallow noisy stream; but they forded the water without much difficulty, and found the ancient steps, \r\nand climbed the high bank. After going a short way they struck the old road, and before long came to a \r\ndeep dell sheltered among the rocks; there they rested for a while and had such a breakfast as they \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould, chiefly cram and water. (If you want to know what cram is, I can only say that I don’t know the \r\nrecipe; but it is biscuitish, keeps good indefinitely, is supposed to be sustaining, and is certainly not \r\nentertaining, being in fact very uninteresting except as a chewing exercise. It was made by the Lake- \r\nmen for long journeys.) \r\n\r\nAfter that they went on again; and now the road struck westwards and left the river, and the great \r\nshoulder of the south-pointing mountain-spur drew ever nearer. At length they reached the hill path. It \r\nscrambled steeply up, and they plodded slowly one behind the other, till at last in the late afternoon \r\nthey came to the top of the ridge and saw the wintry sun going downwards to the West. \r\n\r\nHere they found a flat place without a wall on three sides, but backed to the North by a rocky face \r\nin which there was an opening like a door. From that door there was a wide view East and South and \r\nWest. \r\n\r\n“Here,” said Balin, “in the old days we used always to keep watchmen, and that door behind leads \r\ninto a rockhewn chamber that was made here as a guardroom. There were several places like it round \r\nthe Mountain. But there seemed small need for watching in the days of our prosperity, and the guards \r\nwere made over comfortable, perhaps — otherwise we might have had longer warning of the coming of \r\nthe dragon, and things might have been different. Still, here we can now lie hid and sheltered for a \r\nwhile, and can see much without being seen.” \r\n\r\n“Not much use, if we have been seen coming here,” said Dori, who was always looking up towards \r\nthe Mountain’s peak, as if he expected to see Smaug perched there like a bird on a steeple. \r\n\r\n“We must take our chance of that,” said Thorin. “We can go no further to-day.” \r\n\r\n“Hear, hear!” cried Bilbo, and flung himself on the ground. \r\n\r\nIn the rock-chamber there would have been room for a hundred, and there was a small chamber \r\nfurther in, more removed from the cold outside. It was quite deserted; not even wild animals seemed \r\nto have used it in all the days of Smaug’ s dominion. There they laid their burdens; and some threw \r\nthemselves down at once and slept, but the others sat near the outer door and discussed their plans. In \r\nall their talk they came perpetually back to one thing: where was Smaug? They looked West and there \r\nwas nothing, and East there was nothing, and in the South there was no sign of the dragon, but there \r\nwas a gathering of very many birds. At that they gazed and wondered; but they were no nearer \r\nunderstanding it, when the first cold stars came out."

    "ChapterData": "Now if you wish, like the dwarves, to hear news of Smaug, you must go back again to the evening \r\nwhen he smashed the door and flew off in rage, two days before. \r\n\r\nThe men of the lake-town Esgaroth were mostly indoors, for the breeze was from the black East \r\nand chill, but a few were walking on the quays, and watching, as they were fond of doing, the stars \r\nshine out from the smooth patches of the lake as they opened in the sky. From their town the Lonely \r\nMountain was mostly screened by the low hills at the far end of the lake, through a gap in which the \r\nRunning River came down from the North. Only its high peak could they see in clear weather, and \r\nthey looked seldom at it, for it was ominous and drear even in the light of morning. Now it was lost \r\nand gone, blotted in the dark. \r\n\r\nSuddenly it flickered back to view; a brief glow touched it and faded. \r\n\r\n“Look!” said one. “The lights again! Last night the watchmen saw them start and fade from \r\nmidnight until dawn. Something is happening up there.” \r\n\r\n“Perhaps the King under the Mountain is forging gold,” said another. “It is long since he went \r\nNorth. It is time the songs began to prove themselves again.” \r\n\r\n“Which king?” said another with a grim voice. “As like as not it is the marauding fire of the \r\nDragon, the only king under the Mountain we have ever known.” \r\n\r\n“You are always foreboding gloomy things!” said the others. “Anything from floods to poisoned \r\nfish. Think of something cheerful!” \r\n\r\nThen suddenly a great light appeared in the low place in the hills and the northern end of the lake \r\nturned golden. “The King beneath the Mountain!” they shouted. “His wealth is like the Sun, his silver \r\nlike a fountain, his rivers golden run! The river is running gold from the Mountain!” they cried, and \r\neverywhere windows were opening and feet were hurrying. \r\n\r\nThere was once more a tremendous excitement and enthusiasm. But the grim-voiced fellow ran \r\nhotfoot to the Master. “The dragon is coming or I am a fool!” he cried. “Cut the bridges! To arms! To \r\narms!” \r\n\r\nThen warning trumpets were suddenly sounded, and echoed along the rocky shores. The cheering \r\nstopped and the joy was turned to dread. So it was that the dragon did not find them quite unprepared. \r\n\r\nBefore long, so great was his speed, they could see him as a spark of fire rushing towards them and \r\ngrowing ever huger and more bright, and not the most foolish doubted that the prophecies had gone \r\nrather wrong. Still they had a little time. Every vessel in the town was filled with water, every warrior \r\nwas armed, every arrow and dart was ready, and the bridge to the land was thrown down and \r\ndestroyed, before the roar of Smaug’ s terrible approach grew loud, and the lake rippled red as fire \r\nbeneath the awful beating of his wings. Amid shrieks and wailing and the shouts of men he came over \r\nthem, swept towards the bridges and was foiled! The bridge was gone, and his enemies were on an \r\nisland in deep water — too deep and dark and cool for his liking. If he plunged into it, a vapour and a \r\nsteam would arise enough to cover all the land with a mist for days; but the lake was mightier than he, \r\nit would quench him before he could pass through. \r\n\r\n\r\nRoaring he swept back over the town. A hail of dark arrows leaped up and snapped and rattled on \r\nhis scales and jewels, and their shafts fell back kindled by his breath burning and hissing into the lake. \r\nNo fireworks you ever imagined equalled the sights that night. At the twanging of the bows and the \r\nshrilling of the trumpets the dragon’s wrath blazed to its height, till he was blind and mad with it. No \r\none had dared to give battle to him for many an age; nor would they have dared now, if it had not been \r\nfor the grim-voiced man (Bard was his name), who ran to and fro cheering on the archers and urging \r\nthe Master to order them to fight to the last arrow. \r\n\r\nFire leaped from the dragon’s jaws. He circled for a while high in the air above them lighting all \r\nthe lake; the trees by the shores shone like copper and like blood with leaping shadows of dense black \r\nat their feet. Then down he swooped straight through the arrow-storm, reckless in his rage, taking no \r\nheed to turn his scaly sides towards his foes, seeking only to set their town ablaze. \r\n\r\nFire leaped from thatched roofs and wooden beam-ends as he hurtled down and past and round \r\nagain, though all had been drenched with water before he came. Once more water was flung by a \r\nhundred hands wherever a spark appeared. Back swirled the dragon. A sweep of his tail and the roof of \r\nthe Great House crumbled and smashed down. Flames unquenchable sprang high into the night. \r\nAnother swoop and another, and another house and then another sprang afire and fell; and still no \r\narrow hindered Smaug or hurt him more than a fly from the marshes. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlready men were jumping into the water on every side. Women and children were being huddled into \r\nladen boats in the market-pool. Weapons were flung down. There was mourning and weeping, where \r\nbut a little time ago the old songs of mirth to come had been sung about the dwarves. Now men cursed \r\ntheir names. The Master himself was turning to his great gilded boat, hoping to row away in the \r\nconfusion and save himself. Soon all the town would be deserted and burned down to the surface of \r\nthe lake. \r\n\r\nThat was the dragon’s hope. They could all get into boats for all he cared. There he could have fine \r\nsport hunting them, or they could stop till they starved. Let them try to get to land and he would be \r\nready. Soon he would set all the shoreland woods ablaze and wither every field and pasture. Just now \r\nhe was enjoying the sport of town-baiting more than he had enjoyed anything for years. \r\n\r\nBut there was still a company of archers that held their ground among the burning houses. Their \r\ncaptain was Bard, grim-voiced and grim-faced, whose friends had accused him of prophesying floods \r\nand poisoned fish, though they knew his worth and courage. He was a descendant in long line of \r\nGirion, Lord of Dale, whose wife and child had escaped down the Running River from the ruin long \r\nago. Now he shot with a great yew bow, till all his arrows but one were spent. The flames were near \r\nhim. His companions were leaving him. He bent his bow for the last time. \r\n\r\nSuddenly out of the dark something fluttered to his shoulder. He started — but it was only an old \r\nthrush. Unafraid it perched by his ear and it brought him news. Marvelling he found he could \r\nunderstand its tongue, for he was of the race of Dale. \r\n\r\n“Wait! Wait!” it said to him. “The moon is rising. Look for the hollow of the left breast as he flies \r\nand turns above you!” And while Bard paused in wonder it told him of tidings up in the Mountain and \r\nof all that it had heard. \r\n\r\nThen Bard drew his bow-string to his ear. The dragon was circling back, flying low, and as he came \r\nthe moon rose above the eastern shore and silvered his great wings. \r\n\r\n“Arrow!” said the bowman. “Black arrow! I have saved you to the last. You have never failed me \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand always I have recovered you. I had you from my father and he from of old. If ever you came from \r\nthe forges of the true king under the Mountain, go now and speed well!” \r\n\r\nThe dragon swooped once more lower than ever, and as he turned and dived down his belly \r\nglittered white with sparkling fires of gems in the moon — but not in one place. The great bow \r\ntwanged. The black arrow sped straight from the string, straight for the hollow by the left breast where \r\nthe foreleg was flung wide. In it smote and vanished, barb, shaft and feather, so fierce was its flight. \r\nWith a shriek that deafened men, felled trees and split stone, Smaug shot spouting into the air, turned \r\nover and crashed down from on high in ruin. \r\n\r\nFull on the town he fell. His last throes splintered it to sparks and gledes. The lake roared in. A vast \r\nsteam leaped up, white in the sudden dark under the moon. There was a hiss, a gushing whirl, and then \r\nsilence. And that was the end of Smaug and Esgaroth, but not of Bard. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe waxing moon rose higher and higher and the wind grew loud and cold. It twisted the white fog \r\ninto bending pillars and hurrying clouds and drove it off to the West to scatter in tattered shreds over \r\nthe marshes before Mirkwood. Then the many boats could be seen dotted dark on the surface of the \r\nlake, and down the wind came the voices of the people of Esgaroth lamenting their lost town and \r\ngoods and ruined houses. But they had really much to be thankful for, had they thought of it, though it \r\ncould hardly be expected that they should just then: three quarters of the people of the town had at \r\nleast escaped alive; their woods and fields and pastures and cattle and most of their boats remained \r\nundamaged; and the dragon was dead. What that meant they had not yet realized. \r\n\r\nThey gathered in mournful crowds upon the western shores, shivering in the cold wind, and their \r\nfirst complaints and anger were against the Master, who had left the town so soon, while some were \r\nstill willing to defend it. \r\n\r\n“He may have a good head for business — especially his own business,” some murmured, “but he is \r\nno good when anything serious happens!” And they praised the courage of Bard and his last mighty \r\nshot. “If only he had not been killed,” they all said, “we would make him a king. Bard the Dragon- \r\nshooter of the line of Girion! Alas that he is lost!” \r\n\r\nAnd in the very midst of their talk a tall figure stepped from the shadows. He was drenched with \r\nwater, his black hair hung wet over his face and shoulders, and a fierce light was in his eyes. \r\n\r\n“Bard is not lost!” he cried. “He dived from Esgaroth, when the enemy was slain. I am Bard, of the \r\nline of Girion; I am the slayer of the dragon!” \r\n\r\n“King Bard! King Bard!” they shouted; but the Master ground his chattering teeth. \r\n\r\n“Girion was lord of Dale, not king of Esgaroth,” he said. “In the Lake-town we have always elected \r\nmasters from among the old and wise, and have not endured the rule of mere fighting men. Let 'King \r\nBard’ go back to his own kingdom — Dale is now freed by his valour, and nothing hinders his return. \r\nAnd any that wish can go with him, if they prefer the cold stones under the shadow of the Mountain to \r\nthe green shores of the lake. The wise will stay here and hope to rebuild our town, and enjoy again in \r\ntime its peace and riches.” \r\n\r\n“We will have King Bard!” the people near at hand shouted in reply. “We have had enough of the \r\nold men and the money-counters!” And people further off took up the cry: “Up the Bowman, and down \r\nwith Moneybags,” till the clamour echoed along the shore. \r\n\r\n“I am the last man to undervalue Bard the Bowman,” said the Master warily (for Bard now stood \r\nclose beside him). “He has tonight earned an eminent place in the roll of the benefactors of our town; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand he is worthy of many imperishable songs. But, why O People?” — and here the Master rose to his \r\nfeet and spoke very loud and clear — “Why do I get all your blame? For what fault am I to be deposed? \r\nWho aroused the dragon from his slumber, I might ask? Who obtained of us rich gifts and ample help, \r\nand led us to believe that old songs could come true? Who played on our soft hearts and our pleasant \r\nfancies? What sort of gold have they sent down the river to reward us? Dragon-fire and ruin! From \r\nwhom should we claim the recompense of our damage, and aid for our widows and orphans?” \r\n\r\nAs you see, the Master had not got his position for nothing. The result of his words was that for the \r\nmoment the people quite forgot their idea of a new king, and turned their angry thoughts towards \r\nThorin and his company. Wild and bitter words were shouted from many sides; and some of those who \r\nhad before sung the old songs loudest, were now heard as loudly crying that the dwarves had stirred \r\nthe dragon up against them deliberately! \r\n\r\n“Fools!” said Bard. “Why waste words and wrath on those unhappy creatures? Doubtless they \r\nperished first in fire, before Smaug came to us.” Then even as he was speaking, the thought came into \r\nhis heart of the fabled treasure of the Mountain lying without guard or owner, and he fell suddenly \r\nsilent. He thought of the Master’s words, and of Dale rebuilt, and filled with golden bells, if he could \r\nbut find the men. \r\n\r\nAt length he spoke again: “This is no time for angry words, Master, or for considering weighty \r\nplans of change. There is work to do. I serve you still — though after a while I may think again of your \r\nwords and go North with any that will follow me.” \r\n\r\nThen he strode off to help in the ordering of the camps and in the care of the sick and the wounded. \r\nBut the Master scowled at his back as he went, and remained sitting on the ground. He thought much \r\nbut said little, unless it was to call loudly for men to bring him fire and food. \r\n\r\nNow everywhere Bard went he found talk running like fire among the people concerning the vast \r\ntreasure that was now unguarded. Men spoke of the recompense for all their harm that they would \r\nsoon get from it, and wealth over and to spare with which to buy rich things from the South; and it \r\ncheered them greatly in their plight. That was as well, for the night was bitter and miserable. Shelters \r\ncould be contrived for few (the Master had one) and there was little food (even the Master went short). \r\nMany took ill of wet and cold and sorrow that night, and afterwards died, who had escaped uninjured \r\nfrom the ruin of the town; and in the days that followed there was much sickness and great hunger. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile Bard took the lead, and ordered things as he wished, though always in the Master’s \r\nname, and he had a hard task to govern the people and direct the preparations for their protection and \r\nhousing. Probably most of them would have perished in the winter that now hurried after autumn, if \r\nhelp had not been to hand. But help came swiftly; for Bard at once had speedy messengers sent up the \r\nriver to the Forest to ask the aid of the King of the Elves of the Wood, and these messengers had found \r\na host already on the move, although it was then only the third day after the fall of Smaug. \r\n\r\nThe Elvenking had received news from his own messengers and from the birds that loved his folk, \r\nand already knew much of what had happened. Very great indeed was the commotion among all things \r\nwith wings that dwelt on the borders of the Desolation of the Dragon. The air was filled with circling \r\nflocks, and their swift-flying messengers flew here and there across the sky. Above the borders of the \r\nForest there was whistling, crying and piping. Far over Mirkwood tidings spread: “Smaug is dead!” \r\nLeaves rustled and startled ears were lifted. Even before the Elvenking rode forth the news had passed \r\nwest right to the pinewoods of the Misty Mountains; Beorn had heard it in his wooden house, and the \r\ngoblins were at council in their caves. \r\n\r\n“That will be the last we shall hear of Thorin Oakenshield, I fear,” said the king. “He would have \r\ndone better to have remained my guest. It is an ill wind, all the same,” he added, “that blows no one \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany good.” For he too had not forgotten the legend of the wealth of Thror. So it was that Bard’s \r\nmessengers found him now marching with many spearmen and bowmen; and crows were gathered \r\nthick above him, for they thought that war was awakening again, such as had not been in those parts \r\nfor a long age. \r\n\r\nBut the king, when he received the prayers of Bard, had pity, for he was the lord of a good and \r\nkindly people; so turning his march, which had at first been direct towards the Mountain, he hastened \r\nnow down the river to the Long Lake. He had not boats or rafts enough for his host, and they were \r\nforced to go the slower way by foot; but great store of goods he sent ahead by water. Still elves are \r\nlight-footed, and though they were not in these days much used to the marches and the treacherous \r\nlands between the Forest and the Lake, their going was swift. Only five days after the death of the \r\ndragon they came upon the shores and looked on the ruins of the town. Their welcome was good, as \r\nmay be expected, and the men and their Master were ready to make any bargain for the future in return \r\nfor the Elvenking’s aid. \r\n\r\nTheir plans were soon made. With the women and the children, the old and the unfit, the Master \r\nremained behind; and with him were some men of crafts and many skilled elves; and they busied \r\nthemselves felling trees, and collecting the timber sent down from the Forest. Then they set about \r\nraising many huts by the shore against the oncoming winter; and also under the Master’s direction \r\nthey began the planning of a new town, designed more fair and large even than before, but not in the \r\nsame place. They removed northward higher up the shore; for ever after they had a dread of the water \r\nwhere the dragon lay. He would never again return to his golden bed, but was stretched cold as stone, \r\ntwisted upon the floor of the shallows. There for ages his huge bones could be seen in calm weather \r\namid the ruined piles of the old town. But few dared to cross the cursed spot, and none dared to dive \r\ninto the shivering water or recover the precious stones that fell from his rotting carcase. \r\n\r\nBut all the men of arms who were still able, and the most of the Elvenking’s array, got ready to \r\nmarch north to the Mountain. It was thus that in eleven days from the ruin of the town the head of \r\ntheir host passed the rock-gates at the end of the lake and came into the desolate lands."

    "ChapterData": "Now we will return to Bilbo and the dwarves. All night one of them had watched, but when morning \r\ncame they had not heard or seen any sign of danger. But ever more thickly the birds were gathering. \r\nTheir companies came flying from the South; and the crows that still lived about the Mountain were \r\nwheeling and crying unceasingly above. \r\n\r\n“Something strange is happening,” said Thorin. “The time has gone for the autumn wanderings; \r\nand these are birds that dwell always in the land; there are starlings and flocks of finches; and far off \r\nthere are many carrion birds as if a battle were afoot!” \r\n\r\nSuddenly Bilbo pointed: “There is that old thrush again!” he cried. “He seems to have escaped, \r\nwhen Smaug smashed the mountain-side, but I don’t suppose the snails have!” \r\n\r\nSure enough the old thrush was there, and as Bilbo pointed, he flew towards them and perched on a \r\nstone near by. Then he fluttered his wings and sang; then he cocked his head on one side, as if to \r\nlisten; and again he sang, and again he listened. \r\n\r\n“I believe he is trying to tell us something,” said Balin; “but I cannot follow the speech of such \r\nbirds, it is very quick and difficult. Can you make it out Baggins?” \r\n\r\n“Not very well,” said Bilbo (as a matter of fact, he could make nothing of it at all); “but the old \r\nfellow seems very excited.” \r\n\r\n“I only wish he was a raven!” said Balin. \r\n\r\n“I thought you did not like them! You seemed very shy of them, when we came this way before.” \r\n\r\n“Those were crows! And nasty suspicious-looking creatures at that, and rude as well. You must \r\nhave heard the ugly names they were calling after us. But the ravens are different. There used to be \r\ngreat friendship between them and the people of Thror; and they often brought us secret news, and \r\nwere rewarded with such bright things as they coveted to hide in their dwellings. \r\n\r\n“They live many a year, and their memories are long, and they hand on their wisdom to their \r\nchildren. I knew many among the ravens of the rocks when I was a dwarf-lad. This very height was \r\nonce named Ravenhill, because there was a wise and famous pair, old Care and his wife, that lived \r\nhere above the guard-chamber. But I don’t suppose that any of that ancient breed linger here now.” \r\n\r\nNo sooner had he finished speaking than the old thrush gave a loud call, and immediately flew \r\naway. \r\n\r\n“We may not understand him, but that old bird understands us, I am sure,” said Balin. “Keep watch \r\nnow, and see what happens!” \r\n\r\nBefore long there was a fluttering of wings, and back came the thrush; and with him came a most \r\ndecrepit old bird. He was getting blind, he could hardly fly, and the top of his head was bald. He was \r\nan aged raven of great size. He alighted stiffly on the ground before them, slowly flapped his wings, \r\nand bobbed towards Thorin. \r\n\r\n“O Thorin son of Thrain, and Balin son of Fundin,” he croaked (and Bilbo could understand what \r\nhe said, for he used ordinary language and not bird-speech). “I am Roac son of Care. Care is dead, but \r\nhe was well known to you once. It is a hundred years and three and fifty since I came out of the egg, \r\n\r\n\r\nbut I do not forget what my father told me. Now I am the chief of the great ravens of the Mountain. \r\n\r\nWe are few, but we remember still the king that was of old. Most of my people are abroad, for there \r\nare great tidings in the South — some are tidings of joy to you, and some you will not think so good. \r\n\r\n“Behold! the birds are gathering back again to the Mountain and to Dale from South and East and \r\nWest, for word has gone out that Smaug is dead!” \r\n\r\n“Dead! Dead?” shouted the dwarves. “Dead! Then we have been in needless fear — and the treasure \r\nis ours!” They all sprang up and began to caper about for joy. \r\n\r\n“Yes, dead,” said Roac. “The thrush, may his feathers never fall, saw him die, and we may trust his \r\nwords. He saw him fall in battle with the men of Esgaroth the third night back from now at the rising \r\nof the moon.” \r\n\r\nIt was some time before Thorin could bring the dwarves to be silent and listen to the raven’s news. \r\nAt length when he had told all the tale of the battle he went on: \r\n\r\n“So much for joy, Thorin Oakenshield. You may go back to your halls in safety; all the treasure is \r\nyours — for the moment. But many are gathering hither beside the birds. The news of the death of the \r\nguardian has already gone far and wide, and the legend of the wealth of Thror has not lost in the \r\ntelling during many years; many are eager for a share of the spoil. Already a host of the elves is on the \r\nway, and carrion birds are with them hoping for battle and slaughter. By the lake men murmur that \r\ntheir sorrows are due to the dwarves; for they are homeless and many have died, and Smaug has \r\ndestroyed their town. They too think to find amends from your treasure, whether you are alive or dead. \r\n\r\n“Your own wisdom must decide your course; but thirteen is small remnant of the great folk of \r\nDurin that once dwelt here, and now are scattered far. If you will listen to my counsel, you will not \r\ntrust the Master of the Lake-men, but rather him that shot the dragon with his bow. Bard is he, of the \r\nrace of Dale, of the line of Girion; he is a grim man but true. We would see peace once more among \r\ndwarves and men and elves after the long desolation; but it may cost you dear in gold. I have spoken.” \r\n\r\nThen Thorin burst forth in anger: “Our thanks, Roac Care’s son. You and your people shall not be \r\nforgotten. But none of our gold shall thieves take or the violent carry off while we are alive. If you \r\nwould earn our thanks still more, bring us news of any that draw near. Also I would beg of you, if any \r\nof you are still young and strong of wing, that you would send messengers to our kin in the mountains \r\nof the North, both west from here and east, and tell them of our plight. But go specially to my cousin \r\nDain in the Iron Hills, for he has many people well-armed, and dwells nearest to this place. Bid him \r\nhasten!” \r\n\r\n“I will not say if this counsel be good or bad,” croaked Roac, “but I will do what can be done.” \r\nThen off he slowly flew. \r\n\r\n“Back now to the Mountain!” cried Thorin. “We have little time to lose.” \r\n\r\n“And little food to use!” cried Bilbo, always practical on such points. In any case he felt that the \r\nadventure was, properly speaking, over with the death of the dragon — in which he was much mistaken \r\n— and he would have given most of his share of the profits for the peaceful winding up of these \r\naffairs. \r\n\r\n“Back to the Mountain!” cried the dwarves as if they had not heard him; so back he had to go with \r\nthem. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs you have heard some of the events already, you will see that the dwarves still had some days before \r\nthem. They explored the caverns once more, and found, as they expected, that only the Front Gate \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nremained open; all the other gates (except, of course, the small secret door) had long ago been broken \r\nand blocked by Smaug, and no sign of them remained. So now they began to labour hard in fortifying \r\nthe main entrance, and in making a new path that led from it. Tools were to be found in plenty that the \r\nminers and quarriers and builders of old had used; and at such work the dwarves were still very \r\nskilled. \r\n\r\nAs they worked the ravens brought them constant tidings. In this way they learned that the \r\nElvenking had turned aside to the Lake, and they still had a breathing space. Better still, they heard \r\nthat three of their ponies had escaped and were wandering wild far down the banks of the Running \r\nRiver, not far from where the rest of their stores had been left. So while the others went on with their \r\nwork, Fili and Kili were sent, guided by a raven, to find the ponies and bring back all they could. \r\n\r\nThey were four days gone, and by that time they knew that the joined armies of the Lake-men and \r\nthe Elves were hurrying toward the Mountain. But now their hopes were higher; for they had food for \r\nsome weeks with care — chiefly cram, of course, and they were very tired of it; but cram is much better \r\nthan nothing — and already the gate was blocked with a wall of squared stones laid dry, but very thick \r\nand high, across the opening. There were holes in the wall through which they could see (or shoot), but \r\nno entrance. They climbed in or out with ladders, and hauled stuff up with ropes. For the issuing of the \r\nstream they had contrived a small low arch under the new wall; but near the entrance they had so \r\naltered the narrow bed that a wide pool stretched from the mountain- wall to the head of the fall over \r\nwhich the stream went towards Dale. Approach to the Gate was now only possible, without swimming, \r\nalong a narrow ledge of the cliff, to the right as one looked outwards from the wall. The ponies they \r\nhad brought only to the head of the steps above the old bridge, and unloading them there had bidden \r\nthem return to their masters and sent them back riderless to the South. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere came a night when suddenly there were many lights as of fires and torches away south in Dale \r\nbefore them. \r\n\r\n“They have come!” called Balin. “And their camp is very great. They must have come into the \r\nvalley under the cover of dusk along both banks of the river.” \r\n\r\nThat night the dwarves slept little. The morning was still pale when they saw a company \r\napproaching. From behind their wall they watched them come up to the valley’ s head and climb \r\nslowly up. Before long they could see that both men of the lake armed as if for war and elvish bowmen \r\nwere among them. At length the foremost of these climbed the tumbled rocks and appeared at the top \r\nof the falls; and very great was their surprise to see the pool before them and the Gate blocked with a \r\nwall of new-hewn stone. \r\n\r\nAs they stood pointing and speaking to one another Thorin hailed them: “Who are you,” he called \r\nin a very loud voice, “that come as if in war to the gates of Thorin son of Thrain, King under the \r\nMountain, and what do you desire?” \r\n\r\nBut they answered nothing. Some turned swiftly back, and the others after gazing for a while at the \r\nGate and its defences soon followed them. That day the camp was moved to the east of the river, right \r\nbetween the arms of the Mountain. The rocks echoed then with voices and with song, as they had not \r\ndone for many a day. There was the sound, too, of elven-harps and of sweet music; and as it echoed up \r\ntowards them it seemed that the chill of the air was warmed, and they caught faintly the fragrance of \r\nwoodland flowers blossoming in spring. \r\n\r\nThen Bilbo longed to escape from the dark fortress and to go down and join in the mirth and \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfeasting by the fires. Some of the younger dwarves were moved in their hearts, too, and they muttered \r\nthat they wished things had fallen out otherwise and that they might welcome such folk as friends; but \r\nThorin scowled. \r\n\r\nThen the dwarves themselves brought forth harps and instruments regained from the hoard, and \r\nmade music to soften his mood; but their song was not as elvish song, and was much like the song \r\nthey had sung long before in Bilbo’s little hobbit-hole. \r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the Mountain dark and tall \r\nThe King has come unto his hall! \r\nHis foe is dead, the Worm of Dread, \r\nAnd ever so his foes shall fall. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe sword is sharp, the spear is long, \r\nThe arrow swift, the Gate is strong; \r\n\r\nThe heart is bold that looks on gold; \r\n\r\nThe dwarves no more shall suffer wrong. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe dwarves of yore made mighty spells, \r\nWhile hammers fell like ringing bells \r\nIn places deep, where dark things sleep, \r\nIn hollow halls beneath the fells. \r\n\r\n\r\nOn silver necklaces they strung \r\nThe light of stars, on crowns they hung \r\nThe dragon-fire, from twisted wire \r\nThe melody of harps they wrung. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe mountain throne once more is freed! \r\n\r\nO! wandering folk, the summons heed! Come haste! \r\nCome haste! across the waste! \r\n\r\nThe king of friend and kin has need. \r\n\r\n\r\nNow call we over mountains cold, \r\n‘Come back unto the caverns old’! \r\nHere at the Gates the king awaits, \r\n\r\nHis hands are rich with gems and gold. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe king is come unto his hall \r\nUnder the Mountain dark and tall. \r\n\r\nThe Worm of Dread is slain and dead, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd ever so our foes shall fall! \r\n\r\n\r\nThis song appeared to please Thorin, and he smiled again and grew merry; and he began reckoning \r\nthe distance to the Iron Hills and how long it would be before Dain could reach the Lonely Mountain, \r\nif he had set out as soon as the message reached him. But Bilbo’s heart fell, both at the song and the \r\ntalk: they sounded much too warlike. \r\n\r\nThe next morning early a company of spearmen was seen crossing the river, and marching up the \r\nvalley. They bore with them the green banner of the Elvenking and the blue banner of the Lake, and \r\nthey advanced until they stood right before the wall at the Gate. \r\n\r\nAgain Thorin hailed them in a loud voice: “Who are you that come armed for war to the gates of \r\nThorin son of Thrain, King under the Mountain?” This time he was answered. \r\n\r\nA tall man stood forward, dark of hair and grim of face, and he cried: “Hail Thorin! Why do you \r\nfence yourself like a robber in his hold? We are not yet foes, and we rejoice that you are alive beyond \r\nour hope. We came expecting to find none living here; yet now that we are met there is matter for a \r\nparley and a council.” \r\n\r\n“Who are you, and of what would you parley?” \r\n\r\n“I am Bard, and by my hand was the dragon slain and your treasure delivered. Is that not a matter \r\nthat concerns you? Moreover I am by right descent the heir of Girion of Dale, and in your hoard is \r\nmingled much of the wealth of his halls and towns, which of old Smaug stole. Is not that a matter of \r\nwhich we may speak? Further in his last battle Smaug destroyed the dwellings of the men of Esgaroth, \r\nand I am yet the servant of their Master. I would speak for him and ask whether you have no thought \r\nfor the sorrow and misery of his people. They aided you in your distress, and in recompense you have \r\nthus far brought ruin only, though doubtless undesigned.” \r\n\r\nNow these were fair words and true, if proudly and grimly spoken; and Bilbo thought that Thorin \r\nwould at once admit what justice was in them. He did not, of course, expect that any one would \r\nremember that it was he who discovered all by himself the dragon’s weak spot; and that was just as \r\nwell, for no one ever did. But also he did not reckon with the power that gold has upon which a dragon \r\nhas long brooded, nor with dwarvish hearts. Long hours in the past days Thorin had spent in the \r\ntreasury, and the lust of it was heavy on him. Though he had hunted chiefly for the Arkenstone, yet he \r\nhad an eye for many another wonderful thing that was lying there, about which were wound old \r\nmemories of the labours and the sorrows of his race. \r\n\r\n“You put your worst cause last and in the chief place,” Thorin answered. “To the treasure of my \r\npeople no man has a claim, because Smaug who stole it from us also robbed him of life or home. The \r\ntreasure was not his that his evil deeds should be amended with a share of it. The price of the goods \r\nand the assistance that we received of the Lake-men we will fairly pay — in due time. But nothing will \r\nwe give, not even a loaf’s worth, under threat of force. While an armed host lies before our doors, we \r\nlook on you as foes and thieves. \r\n\r\n“It is in my mind to ask what share of their inheritance you would have paid to our kindred, had \r\nyou found the hoard unguarded and us slain.” \r\n\r\n“A just question,” replied Bard. “But you are not dead, and we are not robbers. Moreover the \r\nwealthy may have pity beyond right on the needy that befriended them when they were in want. And \r\nstill my other claims remain unanswered.” \r\n\r\n“I will not parley, as I have said, with armed men at my gate. Nor at all with the people of the \r\nElvenking, whom I remember with small kindness. In this debate they have no place. Begone now ere \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour arrows fly! And if you would speak with me again, first dismiss the elvish host to the woods where \r\nit belongs, and then return, laying down your arms before you approach the threshold.” \r\n\r\n“The Elvenking is my friend, and he has succoured the people of the Lake in their need, though \r\nthey had no claim but friendship on him,” answered Bard. “We will give you time to repent your \r\nwords. Gather your wisdom ere we return!” Then he departed and went back to the camp. \r\n\r\nEre many hours were past, the banner-bearers returned, and trumpeters stood forth and blew a \r\nblast: \r\n\r\n“In the name of Esgaroth and the Forest,” one cried, “we speak unto Thorin Thrain’s son \r\nOakenshield, calling himself the King under the Mountain, and we bid him consider well the claims \r\nthat have been urged, or be declared our foe. At the least he shall deliver one twelfth portion of the \r\ntreasure unto Bard, as the dragon-slayer, and as the heir of Girion. From that portion Bard will himself \r\ncontribute to the aid of Esgaroth; but if Thorin would have the friendship and honour of the lands \r\nabout, as his sires had of old, then he will give also somewhat of his own for the comfort of the men of \r\nthe Lake.” \r\n\r\nThen Thorin seized a bow of horn and shot an arrow at the speaker. It smote into his shield and \r\nstuck there quivering. \r\n\r\n“Since such is your answer,” he called in return, “I declare the Mountain besieged. You shall not \r\ndepart from it, until you call on your side for a truce and a parley. We will bear no weapons against \r\nyou, but we leave you to your gold. You may eat that, if you will!” \r\n\r\nWith that the messengers departed swiftly, and the dwarves were left to consider their case. So \r\ngrim had Thorin become, that even if they had wished, the others would not have dared to find fault \r\nwith him; but indeed most of them seemed to share his mind — except perhaps old fat Bombur and Fili \r\nand Kili. Bilbo, of course, disapproved of the whole turn of affairs. He had by now had more than \r\nenough of the Mountain, and being besieged inside it was not at all to his taste. \r\n\r\n“The whole place still stinks of dragon,” he grumbled to himself, “and it makes me sick. And cram \r\nis beginning simply to stick in my throat.”"

    "ChapterData": "Now the days passed slowly and wearily. Many of the dwarves spent their time piling and ordering the \r\ntreasure; and now Thorin spoke of the Arkenstone of Thrain, and bade them eagerly to look for it in \r\nevery corner. \r\n\r\n“For the Arkenstone of my father,” he said, “is worth more than a river of gold in itself, and to me \r\nit is beyond price. That stone of all the treasure I name unto myself, and I will be avenged on anyone \r\nwho finds it and withholds it.” \r\n\r\nBilbo heard these words and he grew afraid, wondering what would happen, if the stone was found \r\n— wrapped in an old bundle of tattered oddments that he used as a pillow. All the same he did not \r\nspeak of it, for as the weariness of the days grew heavier, the beginnings of a plan had come into his \r\nlittle head. \r\n\r\nThings had gone on like this for some time, when the ravens brought news that Dain and more than \r\nfive hundred dwarves, hurrying from the Iron Hills, were now within about two days’ march of Dale, \r\ncoming from the North-East. \r\n\r\n“But they cannot reach the Mountain unmarked,” said Roac, “and I fear lest there be battle in the \r\nvalley. I do not call this counsel good. Though they are a grim folk, they are not likely to overcome \r\nthe host that besets you; and even if they did so, what will you gain? Winter and snow is hastening \r\nbehind them. How shall you be fed without the friendship and goodwill of the lands about you? The \r\ntreasure is likely to be your death, though the dragon is no more!” \r\n\r\nBut Thorin was not moved. “Winter and snow will bite both men and elves,” he said, “and they \r\nmay find their dwelling in the waste grievous to bear. With my friends behind them and winter upon \r\nthem, they will perhaps be in softer mood to parley with.” \r\n\r\nThat night Bilbo made up his mind. The sky was black and moonless. As soon as it was full dark, \r\nhe went to a corner of an inner chamber just within the gate and drew from his bundle a rope, and also \r\nthe Arkenstone wrapped in a rag. Then he climbed to the top of the wall. Only Bombur was there, for \r\nit was his turn to watch, and the dwarves kept only one watchman at a time. \r\n\r\n“It is mighty cold!” said Bombur. “I wish we could have a fire up here as they have in the camp!” \r\n\r\n“It is warm enough inside,” said Bilbo. \r\n\r\n“I daresay; but I am bound here till midnight,” grumbled the fat dwarf. “A sorry business \r\naltogether. Not that I venture to disagree with Thorin, may his beard grow ever longer; yet he was ever \r\na dwarf with a stiff neck.” \r\n\r\n“Not as stiff as my legs,” said Bilbo. “I am tired of stairs and stone passages. I would give a good \r\ndeal for the feel of grass at my toes.” \r\n\r\n“I would give a good deal for the feel of a strong drink in my throat, and for a soft bed after a good \r\nsupper!” \r\n\r\n“I can’t give you those, while the siege is going on. \r\n\r\nBut it is long since I watched, and I will take your turn for you, if you like. There is no sleep in me \r\ntonight.” \r\n\r\n\r\n“You are a good fellow, Mr. Baggins, and I will take your offer kindly. If there should be anything \r\nto note, rouse me first, mind you! I will lie in the inner chamber to the left, not far away.” \r\n\r\n“Off you go!” said Bilbo. “I will wake you at midnight, and you can wake the next watchman.” \r\n\r\nAs soon as Bombur had gone, Bilbo put on his ring, fastened his rope, slipped down over the wall, \r\nand was gone. He had about five hours before him. Bombur would sleep (he could sleep at any time, \r\nand ever since the adventure in the forest he was always trying to recapture the beautiful dreams he \r\nhad then); and all the others were busy with Thorin. It was unlikely that any, even Fili or Kili, would \r\ncome out on the wall until it was their turn. \r\n\r\nIt was very dark, and the road after a while, when he left the newly made path and climbed down \r\ntowards the lower course of the stream, was strange to him. At last he came to the bend where he had \r\nto cross the water, if he was to make for the camp, as he wished. The bed of the stream was there \r\nshallow but already broad, and fording it in the dark was not easy for the little hobbit. He was nearly \r\nacross when he missed his footing on a round stone and fell into the cold water with a splash. He had \r\nbarely scrambled out on the far bank, shivering and spluttering, when up came elves in the gloom with \r\nbright lanterns and searched for the cause of the noise. \r\n\r\n“That was no fish!” one said. “There is a spy about. Hide your lights! They will help him more than \r\nus, if it is that queer little creature that is said to be their servant.” \r\n\r\n“Servant, indeed!” snorted Bilbo; and in the middle of his snort he sneezed loudly, and the elves \r\nimmediately gathered towards the sound. \r\n\r\n“Let’s have a light!” he said. “I am here, if you want me!” and he slipped off his ring, and popped \r\nfrom behind a rock. \r\n\r\nThey seized him quickly, in spite of their surprise. “Who are you? Are you the dwarves’ hobbit? \r\nWhat are you doing? How did you get so far past our sentinels?” they asked one after another. \r\n\r\n“I am Mr. Bilbo Baggins,” he answered, “companion of Thorin, if you want to know. I know your \r\nking well by sight, though perhaps he doesn’t know me to look at. But Bard will remember me, and it \r\nis Bard I particularly want to see.” \r\n\r\n“Indeed!” said they, “and what may be your business?” \r\n\r\n“Whatever it is, it’s my own, my good elves. But if you wish ever to get back to your own woods \r\nfrom this cold cheerless place,” he answered shivering, “you will take me along quick to a fire, where \r\nI can dry — and then you will let me speak to your chiefs as quick as may be. I have only an hour or \r\ntwo to spare.” \r\n\r\n\r\nThat is how it came about that some two hours after his escape from the Gate, Bilbo was sitting beside \r\na warm fire in front of a large tent, and there sat too, gazing curiously at him, both the Elvenking and \r\nBard. A hobbit in elvish armour, partly wrapped in an old blanket, was something new to them. \r\n\r\n“Really you know,” Bilbo was saying in his best business manner, “things are impossible. \r\nPersonally I am tired of the whole affair. I wish I was back in the West in my own home, where folk \r\nare more reasonable. But I have an interest in this matter — one fourteenth share, to be precise, \r\naccording to a letter, which fortunately I believe I have kept.” He drew from a pocket in his old jacket \r\n(which he still wore over his mail), crumpled and much folded, Thorin’ s letter that had been put under \r\nthe clock on his mantelpiece in May! \r\n\r\n“A share in the profits, mind you,” he went on. “I am aware of that. Personally I am only too ready \r\nto consider all your claims carefully, and deduct what is right from the total before putting in my own \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclaim. However you don’t know Thorin Oakenshield as well as I do now. I assure you, he is quite \r\nready to sit on a heap of gold and starve, as long as you sit here.” \r\n\r\n“Well, let him!” said Bard. “Such a fool deserves to starve.” \r\n\r\n“Quite so,” said Bilbo. “I see your point of view. At the same time winter is coming on fast. Before \r\nlong you will be having snow and what not, and supplies will be difficult — even for elves I imagine. \r\nAlso there will be other difficulties. You have not heard of Dain and the dwarves of the Iron Hills?” \r\n\r\n“We have, a long time ago; but what has he got to do with us?” asked the king. \r\n\r\n“I thought as much. I see I have some information you have not got. Dain, I may tell you, is now \r\nless than two days’ march off, and has at least five hundred grim dwarves with him — a good many of \r\nthem have had experience in the dreadful dwarf and goblin wars, of which you have no doubt heard. \r\nWhen they arrive there may be serious trouble.” \r\n\r\n“Why do you tell us this? Are you betraying your friends, or are you threatening us?” asked Bard \r\ngrimly. \r\n\r\n“My dear Bard!” squeaked Bilbo. “Don’t be so hasty! I never met such suspicious folk! I am \r\nmerely trying to avoid trouble for all concerned. Now I will make you an offer! !” \r\n\r\n“Let us hear it!” they said. \r\n\r\n“You may see it!” said he. “It is this!” and he drew forth the Arkenstone, and threw away the \r\nwrapping. \r\n\r\nThe Elvenking himself, whose eyes were used to things of wonder and beauty, stood up in \r\namazement. Even Bard gazed marvelling at it in silence. It was as if a globe had been filled with \r\nmoonlight and hung before them in a net woven of the glint of frosty stars. \r\n\r\n“This is the Arkenstone of Thrain,” said Bilbo, “the Heart of the Mountain; and it is also the heart \r\nof Thorin. He values it above a river of gold. I give it to you. It will aid you in your bargaining.” Then \r\nBilbo, not without a shudder, not without a glance of longing, handed the marvellous stone to Bard, \r\nand he held it in his hand, as though dazed. \r\n\r\n“But how is it yours to give?” he asked at last with an effort. \r\n\r\n“O well!” said the hobbit uncomfortably. “It isn’t exactly; but, well, I am willing to let it stand \r\nagainst all my claim, don’t you know. I may be a burglar — or so they say: personally I never really \r\nfelt like one — but I am an honest one, I hope, more or less. Anyway I am going back now, and the \r\ndwarves can do what they like to me. I hope you will find it useful.” \r\n\r\nThe Elvenking looked at Bilbo with a new wonder. “Bilbo Baggins!” he said. “You are more \r\nworthy to wear the armour of elf-princes than many that have looked more comely in it. But I wonder \r\nif Thorin Oakenshield will see it so. I have more knowledge of dwarves in general than you have \r\nperhaps. I advise you to remain with us, and here you shall be honoured and thrice welcome.” \r\n\r\n“Thank you very much I am sure,” said Bilbo with a bow. “But I don’t think I ought to leave my \r\nfriends like this, after all we have gone through together. And I promised to wake old Bombur at \r\nmidnight, too! Really I must be going, and quickly.” \r\n\r\nNothing they could say would stop him; so an escort was provided for him, and as he went both the \r\nking and Bard saluted him with honour. As they passed through the camp an old man, wrapped in a \r\ndark cloak, rose from a tent door where he was sitting and came towards them. \r\n\r\n“Well done! Mr. Baggins!” he said, clapping Bilbo on the back. “There is always more about you \r\nthan anyone expects!” It was Gandalf. \r\n\r\nFor the first time for many a day Bilbo was really delighted. But there was no time for all the \r\nquestions that he immediately wished to ask. \r\n\r\n“All in good time!” said Gandalf. “Things are drawing towards the end now, unless I am mistaken. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is an unpleasant time just in front of you; but keep your heart up! You may come through all \r\nright. There is news brewing that even the ravens have not heard. Good night!” \r\n\r\nPuzzled but cheered, Bilbo hurried on. He was guided to a safe ford and set across dry, and then he \r\nsaid farewell to the elves and climbed carefully back towards the Gate. Great weariness began to come \r\nover him; but it was well before midnight when he clambered up the rope again — it was still where he \r\nhad left it. He untied it and hid it, and then he sat down on the wall and wondered anxiously what \r\nwould happen next. \r\n\r\nAt midnight he woke up Bombur; and then in turn rolled himself up in his corner, without listening \r\nto the old dwarf’s thanks (which he felt he had hardly earned). He was soon fast asleep forgetting all \r\nhis worries till the morning. As a matter of fact he was dreaming of eggs and bacon."

    "ChapterData": "Next day the trumpets rang early in the camp. Soon a single runner was seen hurrying along the \r\nnarrow path. At a distance he stood and hailed them, asking whether Thorin would now listen to \r\nanother embassy, since new tidings had come to hand, and matters were changed. \r\n\r\n“That will be Dain!” said Thorin when he heard. “They will have got wind of his coming. I thought \r\nthat would alter their mood! Bid them come few in number and weaponless, and I will hear,” he called \r\nto the messenger. \r\n\r\nAbout midday the banners of the Forest and the Lake were seen to be borne forth again. A company \r\nof twenty was approaching. At the beginning of the narrow way they laid aside sword and spear, and \r\ncame on towards the Gate. Wondering, the dwarves saw that among them were both Bard and the \r\nElvenking, before whom an old man wrapped in cloak and hood bore a strong casket of iron-bound \r\nwood. \r\n\r\n“Hail Thorin!” said Bard. “Are you still of the same mind?” \r\n\r\n“My mind does not change with the rising and setting of a few suns,” answered Thorin. “Did you \r\ncome to ask me idle questions? Still the elf-host has not departed as I bade! Till then you come in vain \r\nto bargain with me.” \r\n\r\n“Is there then nothing for which you would yield any of your gold?” \r\n\r\n“Nothing that you or your friends have to offer.” \r\n\r\n“What of the Arkenstone of Thrain?” said he, and at the same moment the old man opened the \r\ncasket and held aloft the jewel. The light leapt from his hand, bright and white in the morning. \r\n\r\nThen Thorin was stricken dumb with amazement and confusion. No one spoke for a long while. \r\n\r\nThorin at length broke the silence, and his voice was thick with wrath. “That stone was my father’s, \r\nand is mine,” he said. “Why should I purchase my own?” But wonder overcame him and he added: \r\n“But how came you by the heirloom of my house — if there is need to ask such a question of thieves?” \r\n\r\n“We are not thieves,” Bard answered. “Your own we will give back in return for our own.” \r\n\r\n“How came you by it?” shouted Thorin in gathering rage. \r\n\r\n“I gave it to them!” squeaked Bilbo, who was peering over the wall, by now in a dreadful fright. \r\n\r\n“You! You!” cried Thorin, turning upon him and grasping him with both hands. “You miserable \r\nhobbit! You undersized — burglar!” he shouted at a loss for words, and he shook poor Bilbo like a \r\nrabbit. \r\n\r\n“By the beard of Durin! I wish I had Gandalf here! Curse him for his choice of you! May his beard \r\nwither! As for you I will throw you to the rocks!” he cried and lifted Bilbo in his arms. \r\n\r\n“Stay! Your wish is granted!” said a voice. The old man with the casket threw aside his hood and \r\ncloak. “Here is Gandalf! And none too soon it seems. If you don’t like my Burglar, please don’t \r\ndamage him. \r\n\r\nPut him down, and listen first to what he has to say!” \r\n\r\n“You all seem in league!” said Thorin dropping Bilbo on the top of the wall. “Never again will I \r\nhave dealings with any wizard or his friends. What have you to say, you descendant of rats?” \r\n\r\n\r\n“Dear me! Dear me!” said Bilbo. “I am sure this is all very uncomfortable. You may remember \r\nsaying that I might choose my own fourteenth share? Perhaps I took it too literally — I have been told \r\nthat dwarves are sometimes politer in word than in deed. The time was, all the same, when you \r\nseemed to think that I had been of some service. Descendant of rats, indeed! Is this all the service of \r\nyou and your family that I was promised, Thorin? Take it that I have disposed of my share as I wished, \r\nand let it go at that!” \r\n\r\n“I will,” said Thorin grimly. “And I will let you go at that — and may we never meet again!” Then \r\nhe turned and spoke over the wall. “I am betrayed,” he said. “It was rightly guessed that I could not \r\nforbear to redeem the Arkenstone, the treasure of my house. For it I will give one fourteenth share of \r\nthe hoard in silver and gold, setting aside the gems; but that shall be accounted the promised share of \r\nthis traitor, and with that reward he shall depart, and you can divide it as you will. He will get little \r\nenough, I doubt not. Take him, if you wish him to live; and no friendship of mine goes with him. \r\n\r\n“Get down now to your friends!” he said to Bilbo, “or I will throw you down.” \r\n\r\n“What about the gold and silver?” asked Bilbo. “That shall follow after, as can be arranged,” said \r\nhe. “Get down!” \r\n\r\n“Until then we keep the stone,” cried Bard. \r\n\r\n“You are not making a very splendid figure as King under the Mountain,” said Gandalf. “But things \r\nmay change yet.” \r\n\r\n“They may indeed,” said Thorin. And already, so strong was the bewilderment of the treasure upon \r\nhim, he was pondering whether by the help of Dain he might not recapture the Arkenstone and \r\nwithhold the share of the reward. \r\n\r\nAnd so Bilbo was swung down from the wall, and departed with nothing for all his trouble, except \r\nthe armour which Thorin had given him already. More than one of the dwarves in their hearts felt \r\nshame and pity at his going. \r\n\r\n“Farewell!” he cried to them. “We may meet again as friends.” \r\n\r\n“Be off!” called Thorin. “You have mail upon you, which was made by my folk, and is too good for \r\nyou. It cannot be pierced by arrows; but if you do not hasten, I will sting your miserable feet. So be \r\nswift!” \r\n\r\n“Not so hasty!” said Bard. “We will give you until tomorrow. At noon we will return, and see if \r\nyou have brought from the hoard the portion that is to be set against the stone. If that is done without \r\ndeceit, then we will depart, and the elf-host will go back to the Forest. In the meanwhile farewell!” \r\n\r\nWith that they went back to the camp; but Thorin sent messengers by Roac telling Dain of what \r\nhad passed, and bidding him come with wary speed. \r\n\r\n\r\nThat day passed and the night. The next day the wind shifted west, and the air was dark and gloomy. \r\nThe morning was still early when a cry was heard in the camp. Runners came in to report that a host of \r\ndwarves had appeared round the eastern spur of the Mountain and was now hastening to Dale. Dain \r\nhad come. He had hurried on through the night, and so had come upon them sooner than they had \r\nexpected. Each one of his folk was clad in a hauberk of steel mail that hung to his knees, and his legs \r\nwere covered with hose of a fine and flexible metal mesh, the secret of whose making was possessed \r\nby Dain’s people. The dwarves are exceedingly strong for their height, but most of these were strong \r\neven for dwarves. In battle they wielded heavy two-handed mattocks; but each of them had also a \r\nshort broad sword at his side and a roundshield slung at his back. Their beards were forked and plaited \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand thrust into their belts. Their caps were of iron and they were shod with iron, and their faces were \r\ngrim. \r\n\r\nTrumpets called men and elves to arms. Before long the dwarves could be seen coming up the \r\nvalley at a great pace. They halted between the river and the eastern spur; but a few held on their way, \r\nand crossing the river drew near the camp; and there they laid down their weapons and held up their \r\nhands in sign of peace. Bard went out to meet them, and with him went Bilbo. \r\n\r\n“We are sent from Dain son of Nain,” they said when questioned. “We are hastening to our \r\nkinsmen in the Mountain, since we learn that the kingdom of old is renewed. But who are you that sit \r\nin the plain as foes before defended walls?” This, of course, in the polite and rather old-fashioned \r\nlanguage of such occasions, meant simply: “You have no business here. We are going on, so make \r\nway or we shall fight you!” They meant to push on between the Mountain and the loop of the river; for \r\nthe narrow land there did not seem to be strongly guarded. \r\n\r\nBard, of course, refused to allow the dwarves to go straight on to the Mountain. He was determined \r\nto wait until the gold and silver had been brought out in exchange for the Arkenstone; for he did not \r\nbelieve that this would be done, if once the fortress was manned with so large and warlike a company. \r\nThey had brought with them a great store of supplies; for the dwarves can carry very heavy burdens, \r\nand nearly all of Dain’s folk, in spite of their rapid march, bore huge packs on their backs in addition \r\nto their weapons. They would stand a siege for weeks, and by that time yet more dwarves might come, \r\nand yet more, for Thorin had many relatives. Also they would be able to reopen and guard some other \r\ngate, so that the besiegers would have to encircle the whole mountain; and for that they had not \r\nsufficient numbers. \r\n\r\nThese were, in fact, precisely their plans (for the raven-messengers had been busy between Thorin \r\nand Dain); but for the moment the way was barred, so after angry words the dwarf-messengers retired \r\nmuttering in their beards. Bard then sent messengers at once to the Gate; but they found no gold or \r\npayment. Arrows came forth as soon as they were within shot, and they hastened back in dismay. In \r\nthe camp all was now astir, as if for battle; for the dwarves of Dain were advancing along the eastern \r\nbank. \r\n\r\n“Fools!” laughed Bard, “to come thus beneath the Mountain’s arm! They do not understand war \r\nabove ground, whatever they may know of battle in the mines. There are many of our archers and \r\nspearmen now hidden in the rocks upon their right flank. Dwarf-mail may be good, but they will soon \r\nbe hard put to it. Let us set on them now from both sides, before they are fully rested!” \r\n\r\nBut the Elvenking said: “Long will I tarry, ere I begin this war for gold. The dwarves cannot pass \r\nus, unless we will, or do anything that we cannot mark. Let us hope still for something that will bring \r\nreconciliation. Our advantage in numbers will be enough, if in the end it must come to unhappy \r\nblows.” \r\n\r\nBut he reckoned without the dwarves. The knowledge that the Arkenstone was in the hands of the \r\nbesiegers burned in their thoughts; also they guessed the hesitation of Bard and his friends, and \r\nresolved to strike while they debated. \r\n\r\nSuddenly without a signal they sprang silently forward to attack. Bows twanged and arrows \r\nwhistled; battle was about to be joined. \r\n\r\nStill more suddenly a darkness came on with dreadful swiftness! A black cloud hurried over the \r\nsky. Winter thunder on a wild wind rolled roaring up and rumbled in the Mountain, and lightning lit \r\nits peak. And beneath the thunder another blackness could be seen whirling forward; but it did not \r\ncome with the wind, it came from the North, like a vast cloud of birds, so dense that no light could be \r\nseen between their wings. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Halt!” cried Gandalf, who appeared suddenly, and stood alone, with arms uplifted, between the \r\nadvancing dwarves and the ranks awaiting them. “Halt!” he called in a voice like thunder, and his staff \r\nblazed forth with a flash like the lightning. “Dread has come upon you all! Alas! it has come more \r\nswiftly than I guessed. The Goblins are upon you! Bolg- of the North is coming, O Dain! whose father \r\nyou slew in Moria. Behold! the bats are above his army like a sea of locusts. They ride upon wolves \r\nand Wargs are in their train!” \r\n\r\nAmazement and confusion fell upon them all. Even as Gandalf had been speaking the darkness \r\ngrew. The dwarves halted and gazed at the sky. The elves cried out with many voices. \r\n\r\n“Come!” called Gandalf. “There is yet time for council. Let Dain son of Nain come swiftly to us!” \r\n\r\n\r\nSo began a battle that none had expected; and it was called the Battle of Five Armies, and it was very \r\nterrible. Upon one side were the Goblins and the Wild Wolves, and upon the other were Elves and \r\nMen and Dwarves. This is how it fell out. Ever since the fall of the Great Goblin of the Misty \r\nMountains the hatred of their race for the dwarves had been rekindled to fury. Messengers had passed \r\nto and fro between all their cities, colonies and strongholds; for they resolved now to win the \r\ndominion of the North. Tidings they had gathered in secret ways; and in all the mountains there was a \r\nforging and an arming. Then they marched and gathered by hill and valley, going ever by tunnel or \r\nunder dark, until around and beneath the great mountain Gundabad of the North, where was their \r\ncapital, a vast host was assembled ready to sweep down in time of storm unawares \r\n\r\nupon the South. Then they learned of the death of Smaug, and joy was in their hearts; and they \r\nhastened night after night through the mountains, and came thus at last on a sudden from the North \r\nhard on the heels of Dain. Not even the ravens knew of their coming until they came out in the broken \r\nlands which divided the Lonely Mountain from the hills behind. How much Gandalf knew cannot be \r\nsaid, but it is plain that he had not expected this sudden assault. \r\n\r\nThis is the plan that he made in council with the Elven-king and with Bard; and with Dain, for the \r\ndwarf-lord now joined them: the Goblins were the foes of all, and at their coming all other quarrels \r\nwere forgotten. Their only hope was to lure the goblins into the valley between the arms of the \r\nMountain; and themselves to man the great spurs that struck south and east. Yet this would be \r\nperilous, if the goblins were in sufficient numbers to overrun the Mountain itself, and so attack them \r\nalso from behind and above; but there was no time to make any other plan, or to summon any help. \r\n\r\nSoon the thunder passed, rolling away to the South-East; but the bat-cloud came, flying lower, over \r\nthe shoulder of the Mountain, and whirled above them shutting out the light and filling them with \r\ndread. \r\n\r\n“To the Mountain!” called Bard. “To the Mountain! Let us take our places while there is yet time!” \r\n\r\nOn the Southern spur, in its lower slopes and in the rocks at its feet, the Elves were set; on the \r\nEastern spur were men and dwarves. But Bard and some of the nimblest of men and elves climbed to \r\nthe height of the Eastern shoulder to gain a view to the North. Soon they could see the lands before the \r\nMountain’s feet black with a hurrying multitude. Ere long the vanguard swirled round the spur’s end \r\nand came rushing into Dale. These were the swiftest wolf-riders, and already their cries and howls rent \r\nthe air afar. A few brave men were strung before them to make a feint of resistance, and many there \r\nfell before the rest drew back and fled to either side. As Gandalf had hoped, the goblin army had \r\ngathered behind the resisted vanguard, and poured now in rage into the valley, driving wildly up \r\nbetween the arms of the Mountain, seeking for the foe. Their banners were countless, black and red, \r\n\r\n\r\nand they came on like a tide in fury and disorder. \r\n\r\nIt was a terrible battle. The most dreadful of all Bilbo’s experiences, and the one which at the time \r\nhe hated most — which is to say it was the one he was most proud of, and most fond of recalling long \r\nafterwards, although he was quite unimportant in it. Actually I may say he put on his ring early in the \r\nbusiness, and vanished from sight, if not from all danger. A magic ring of that sort is not a complete \r\nprotection in a goblin charge, nor does it stop flying arrows and wild spears; but it does help in getting \r\nout of the way, and it prevents your head from being specially chosen for a sweeping stroke by a \r\ngoblin swordsman. \r\n\r\nThe elves were the first to charge. Their hatred for the goblins is cold and bitter. Their spears and \r\nswords shone in the gloom with a gleam of chill flame, so deadly was the wrath of the hands that held \r\nthem. As soon as the host of their enemies was dense in the valley, they sent against it a shower of \r\narrows, and each flickered as it fled as if with stinging fire. Behind the arrows a thousand of their \r\nspearmen leapt down and charged. The yells were deafening. The rocks were stained black with goblin \r\nblood. \r\n\r\nJust as the goblins were recovering from the onslaught and the elf-charge was halted, there rose \r\nfrom across the valley a deep-throated roar. With cries of “Moria!” and “Dain, Dain!” the dwarves of \r\nthe Iron Hills plunged in, wielding their mattocks, upon the other side; and beside them came the men \r\nof the Lake with long swords. \r\n\r\nPanic came upon the Goblins; and even as they turned to meet this new attack, the elves charged \r\nagain with renewed numbers. Already many of the goblins were flying back down the river to escape \r\nfrom the trap; and many of their own wolves were turning upon them and rending the dead and the \r\nwounded. Victory seemed at hand, when a cry rang out on the heights above. \r\n\r\nGoblins had scaled the Mountain from the other side and already many were on the slopes above \r\nthe Gate, and others were streaming down recklessly, heedless of those that fell screaming from cliff \r\nand precipice, to attack the spurs from above. Each of these could be reached by paths that ran down \r\nfrom the main mass of the Mountain in the centre; and the defenders had too few to bar the way for \r\nlong. Victory now vanished from hope. They had only stemmed the first onslaught of the black tide. \r\n\r\nDay drew on. The goblins gathered again in the valley. There a host of Wargs came ravening and \r\nwith them came the bodyguard of Bolg, goblins of huge size with scimitars of steel. Soon actual \r\ndarkness was coming into a stormy sky; while still the great bats swirled about the heads and ears of \r\nelves and men, or fastened vampire-like on the stricken. Now Bard was fighting to defend the Eastern \r\nspur, and yet giving slowly back; and the elf-lords were at bay about their king upon the southern arm, \r\nnear to the watch-post on Ravenhill. \r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a great shout, and from the Gate came a trumpet call. They had forgotten \r\nThorin! Part of the wall, moved by levers, fell outward with a crash into the pool. Out leapt the King \r\nunder the Mountain, and his companions followed him. Hood and cloak were gone; they were in \r\nshining armour, and red light leapt from their eyes. In the gloom the great dwarf gleamed like gold in \r\na dying fire. \r\n\r\nRocks were hurled down from on high by the goblins above; but they held on, leapt down to the \r\nfalls’ foot, and rushed forward to battle. Wolf and rider fell or fled before them. Thorin wielded his \r\naxe with mighty strokes, and nothing seemed to harm him. \r\n\r\n“To me! To me! Elves and Men! To me! O my kinsfolk!” he cried, and his voice shook like a horn \r\nin the valley. \r\n\r\nDown, heedless of order, rushed all the dwarves of Dain to his help. Down too came many of the \r\nLake-men, for Bard could not restrain them; and out upon the other side came many of the spearmen \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the elves. Once again the goblins were stricken in the valley; and they were piled in heaps till Dale \r\nwas dark and hideous with their corpses. The Wargs were scattered and Thorin drove right against the \r\nbodyguard of Bolg. But he could not pierce their ranks. \r\n\r\nAlready behind him among the goblin dead lay many men and many dwarves, and many a fair elf \r\nthat should have lived yet long ages merrily in the wood. And as the valley widened his onset grew \r\never slower. His numbers were too few. His flanks were unguarded. Soon the attackers were attacked, \r\nand they were forced into a great ring, facing every way, hemmed all about with goblins and wolves \r\nreturning to the assault. The bodyguard of Bolg came howling against them, and drove in upon their \r\nranks like waves upon cliffs of sand. Their friends could not help them, for the assault from the \r\nMountain was renewed with redoubled force, and upon either side men and elves were being slowly \r\nbeaten down. \r\n\r\nOn all this Bilbo looked with misery. He had taken his stand on Ravenhill among the Elves — partly \r\nbecause there was more chance of escape from that point, and partly (with the more Tookish part of \r\nhis mind) because if he was going to be in a last desperate stand, he preferred on the whole to defend \r\nthe Elvenking. Gandalf, too, I may say, was there, sitting on the ground as if in deep thought, \r\npreparing, I suppose, some last blast of magic before the end. \r\n\r\nThat did not seem far off. “It will not be long now,” thought Bilbo, “before the goblins win the \r\nGate, and we are all slaughtered or driven down and captured. Really it is enough to make one weep, \r\nafter all one has gone through. I would rather old Smaug had been left with all the wretched treasure, \r\nthan that these vile creatures should get it, and poor old Bombur, and Balin and Fili and Kili and all \r\nthe rest come to a bad end; and Bard too, and the Lake-men and the merry elves. Misery me! I have \r\nheard songs of many battles, and I have always understood that defeat may be glorious. It seems very \r\nuncomfortable, not to say distressing. I wish I was well out of it.” \r\n\r\nThe clouds were torn by the wind, and a red sunset slashed the West. Seeing the sudden gleam in \r\nthe gloom Bilbo looked round. He gave a great cry: he had seen a sight that made his heart leap, dark \r\nshapes small yet majestic against the distant glow. \r\n\r\n“The Eagles! The Eagles!” he shouted. “The Eagles are coming!” \r\n\r\nBilbo’s eyes were seldom wrong. The eagles were coming down the wind, line after line, in such a \r\nhost as must have gathered from all the eyries of the North. \r\n\r\n“The Eagles! the Eagles!” Bilbo cried, dancing and waving his arms. If the elves could not see him \r\nthey could hear him. Soon they too took up the cry, and it echoed across the valley. Many wondering \r\neyes looked up, though as yet nothing could be seen except from the southern shoulders of the \r\nMountain. \r\n\r\n“The Eagles!” cried Bilbo once more, but at that moment a stone hurtling from above smote \r\nheavily on his helm, and he fell with a crash and knew no more."

    "ChapterData": "When Bilbo came to himself, he was literally by himself. He was lying on the flat stones of Ravenhill, \r\nand no one was near. A cloudless day, but cold, was broad above him. He was shaking, and as chilled \r\nas stone, but his head burned with fire. \r\n\r\n“Now I wonder what has happened?” he said to himself. “At any rate I am not yet one of the fallen \r\nheroes; but I suppose there is still time enough for that!” \r\n\r\nHe sat up painfully. Looking into the valley he could see no living goblins. After a while as his \r\nhead cleared a little, he thought he could see elves moving in the rocks below. He rubbed his eyes. \r\nSurely there was a camp still in the plain some distance off; and there was a coming and going about \r\nthe Gate? Dwarves seemed to be busy removing the wall. But all was deadly still. There was no call \r\nand no echo of a song. Sorrow seemed to be in the air. \r\n\r\n“Victory after all, I suppose!” he said, feeling his aching head. “Well, it seems a very gloomy \r\nbusiness.” \r\n\r\nSuddenly he was aware of a man climbing up and coming towards him. \r\n\r\n“Hullo there!” he called with a shaky voice. “Hullo there! What news?” \r\n\r\n“What voice is it that speaks among the stones?” said the man halting and peering about him not \r\nfar from where Bilbo sat. \r\n\r\nThen Bilbo remembered his ring! “Well I’m blessed!” said he. “This invisibility has its drawbacks \r\nafter all. Otherwise I suppose I might have spent a warm and comfortable night in bed!” \r\n\r\n“It’s me, Bilbo Baggins, companion of Thorin!” he cried, hurriedly taking off the ring. \r\n\r\n“It is well that I have found you!” said the man striding forward. “You are needed and we have \r\nlooked for you long. You would have been numbered among the dead, who are many, if Gandalf the \r\nwizard had not said that your voice was last heard in this place. I have been sent to look here for the \r\nlast time. Are you much hurt?” \r\n\r\n“A nasty knock on the head, I think,” said Bilbo. “But I have a helm and a hard skull. All the same \r\nI feel sick and my legs are like straws.” \r\n\r\n“I will carry you down to the camp in the valley,” said the man, and picked him lightly up. \r\n\r\nThe man was swift and sure-footed. It was not long before Bilbo was set down before a tent in \r\nDale; and there stood Gandalf, with his arm in a sling. Even the wizard had not escaped without a \r\nwound; and there were few unharmed in all the host. \r\n\r\nWhen Gandalf saw Bilbo, he was delighted. “Baggins!” he exclaimed. “Well I never! Alive after \r\nall — I am glad! I began to wonder if even your luck would see you through! A terrible business, and it \r\nnearly was disastrous. But other news can wait. Come!” he said more gravely. “You are called for;” \r\nand leading the hobbit he took him within the tent. \r\n\r\n“Hail! Thorin,” he said as he entered. “I have brought him.” \r\n\r\nThere indeed lay Thorin Oakenshield, wounded with many wounds, and his rent armour and \r\nnotched axe were cast upon the floor. He looked up as Bilbo came beside him. \r\n\r\n“Farewell, good thief,” he said. “I go now to the halls of waiting to sit beside my fathers, until the \r\n\r\n\r\nworld is renewed. Since I leave now all gold and silver, and go where it is of little worth, I wish to part \r\nin friendship from you, and I would take back my words and deeds at the Gate.” \r\n\r\nBilbo knelt on one knee filled with sorrow. “Farewell, King under the Mountain!” he said. “This is \r\na bitter adventure, if it must end so; and not a mountain of gold can amend it. Yet I am glad that I have \r\nshared in your perils — that has been more than any Baggins deserves.” \r\n\r\n“No!” said Thorin. “There is more in you of good than you know, child of the kindly West. Some \r\ncourage and some wisdom, blended in measure. If more of us valued food and cheer and song above \r\nhoarded gold, it would be a merrier world. But sad or merry, I must leave it now. Farewell!” \r\n\r\nThen Bilbo turned away, and he went by himself, and sat alone wrapped in a blanket, and, whether \r\nyou believe it or not, he wept until his eyes were red and his voice was hoarse. He was a kindly little \r\nsoul. Indeed it was long before he had the heart to make a joke again. “A mercy it is,” he said at last to \r\nhimself, “that I woke up when I did. I wish Thorin were living, but I am glad that we parted in \r\nkindness. You are a fool, Bilbo Baggins, and you made a great mess of that business with the stone; \r\nand there was a battle, in spite of all your efforts to buy peace and quiet, but I suppose you can hardly \r\nbe blamed for that.” \r\n\r\n\r\nAll that had happened after he was stunned, Bilbo learned later; but it gave him more sorrow than joy, \r\nand he was now weary of his adventure. He was aching in his bones for the homeward journey. That, \r\nhowever, was a little delayed, so in the meantime I will tell something of events. The Eagles had long \r\nhad suspicion of the goblins’ mustering; from their watchfulness the movements in the mountains \r\ncould not be altogether hid. So they too had gathered in great numbers, under the great Eagle of the \r\nMisty Mountains; and at length smelling battle from afar they had come speeding down the gale in the \r\nnick of time. They it was who dislodged the goblins from the mountain-slopes, casting them over \r\nprecipices, or driving them down shrieking and bewildered among their foes. It was not long before \r\nthey had freed the Lonely Mountain, and elves and men on either side of the valley could come at last \r\nto the help of the battle below. \r\n\r\nBut even with the Eagles they were still outnumbered. In that last hour Beorn himself had appeared \r\n— no one knew how or from where. He came alone, and in bear’s shape; and he seemed to have grown \r\nalmost to giant-size in his wrath. \r\n\r\nThe roar of his voice was like drums and guns; and he tossed wolves and goblins from his path like \r\nstraws and feathers. He fell upon their rear, and broke like a clap of thunder through the ring. The \r\ndwarves were making a stand still about their lords upon a low rounded hill. Then Beorn stooped and \r\nlifted Thorin, who had fallen pierced with spears, and bore him out of the fray. \r\n\r\nSwiftly he returned and his wrath was redoubled, so that nothing could withstand him, and no \r\nweapon seemed to bite upon him. He scattered the bodyguard, and pulled down Bolg himself and \r\ncrushed him. Then dismay fell on the Goblins and they fled in all directions. But weariness left their \r\nenemies with the coming of new hope, and they pursued them closely, and prevented most of them \r\nfrom escaping where they could. They drove many of them into the Running River, and such as fled \r\nsouth or west they hunted into the marshes about the Forest River; and there the greater part of the last \r\nfugitives perished, while those that came hardly to the Wood-elves’ realm were there slain, or drawn \r\nin to die deep in the trackless dark of Mirkwood. Songs have said that three parts of the goblin \r\nwarriors of the North perished on that day, and the mountains had peace for many a year. \r\n\r\nVictory had been assured before the fall of night; but the pursuit was still on foot, when Bilbo \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreturned to the camp; and not many were in the valley save the more grievously wounded. \r\n\r\n“Where are the Eagles?” he asked Gandalf that evening, as he lay wrapped in many warm blankets. \r\n\r\n“Some are in the hunt,” said the wizard, “but most have gone back to their eyries. They would not \r\nstay here, and departed with the first light of morning. Dain has crowned their chief with gold, and \r\nsworn friendship with them forever.” \r\n\r\n“I am sorry. I mean, I should have liked to see them again,” said Bilbo sleepily; “perhaps I shall \r\nsee them on the way home. I suppose I shall be going home soon?” \r\n\r\n“As soon as you like,” said the wizard. \r\n\r\nActually it was some days before Bilbo really set out. They buried Thorin deep beneath the \r\nMountain, and Bard laid the Arkenstone upon his breast. \r\n\r\n“There let it lie till the Mountain falls!” he said. “May it bring good fortune to all his folk that \r\ndwell here after!” \r\n\r\nUpon his tomb the Elvenking then laid Orcrist, the elvish sword that had been taken from Thorin in \r\ncaptivity. It is said in songs that it gleamed ever in the dark if foes approached, and the fortress of the \r\ndwarves could not be taken by surprise. There now Dain son of Nain took up his abode, and he became \r\nKing under the Mountain, and in time many other dwarves gathered to his throne in the ancient halls. \r\nOf the twelve companions of Thorin, ten remained. Fili and Kili had fallen defending him with shield \r\nand body, for he was their mother’s elder brother. The others remained with Dain; for Dain dealt his \r\ntreasure well. \r\n\r\nThere was, of course, no longer any question of dividing the hoard in such shares as had been \r\nplanned, to Balin and Dwalin, and Dori and Nori and Ori, and Oin and Gloin, and Bifur and Bofur and \r\nBombur — or to Bilbo. Yet a fourteenth share of all the silver and gold, wrought and unwrought, was \r\ngiven up to Bard; for Dain said: “We will honour the agreement of the dead, and he has now the \r\nArkenstone in his keeping.” \r\n\r\nEven a fourteenth share was wealth exceedingly great, greater than that of many mortal kings. \r\n\r\nFrom that treasure Bard sent much gold to the Master of Lake-town; and he rewarded his followers \r\nand friends freely. To the Elvenking he gave the emeralds of Girion, such jewels as he most loved, \r\nwhich Dain had restored to him. \r\n\r\nTo Bilbo he said: “This treasure is as much yours as it is mine; though old agreements cannot \r\nstand, since so many have a claim in its winning and defence. Yet even though you were willing to lay \r\naside all your claim, I should wish that the words of Thorin, of which he repented, should not prove \r\ntrue: that we should give you little. I would reward you most richly of all.” \r\n\r\n“Very kind of you,” said Bilbo. “But really it is a relief to me. How on earth should I have got all \r\nthat treasure home without war and murder all along the way, I don’t know. And I don’t know what I \r\nshould have done with it when I got home. I am sure it is better in your hands.” \r\n\r\nIn the end he would only take two small chests, one filled with silver, and the other with gold, such \r\nas one strong pony could carry. “That will be quite as much as I can manage,” said he. \r\n\r\nAt last the time came for him to say good-bye to his friends. “Farewell, Balin!” he said; “and \r\nfarewell, Dwalin; and farewell Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur! May your \r\nbeards never grow thin!” And turning towards the Mountain he added: “Farewell Thorin Oakenshield! \r\nAnd Fili and Kili! May your memory never fade!” \r\n\r\nThen the dwarves bowed low before their Gate, but words stuck in their throats. “Good-bye and \r\ngood luck, wherever you fare!” said Balin at last. “If ever you visit us again, when our halls are made \r\nfair once more, then the feast shall indeed be splendid!” \r\n\r\n“If ever you are passing my way,” said Bilbo, “don’t wait to knock! Tea is at four; but any of you \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare welcome at any time ! ” \r\nThen he turned away. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe elf-host was on the march; and if it was sadly lessened, yet many were glad, for now the northern \r\nworld would be merrier for many a long day. The dragon was dead, and the goblins overthrown, and \r\ntheir hearts looked forward after winter to a spring of joy. \r\n\r\nGandalf and Bilbo rode behind the Elvenking, and beside them strode Beorn, once again in man’s \r\nshape, and he laughed and sang in a loud voice upon the road. So they went on until they drew near to \r\nthe borders of Mirkwood, to the north of the place where the Forest River ran out. Then they halted, \r\nfor the wizard and Bilbo would not enter the wood, even though the king bade them stay a while in his \r\nhalls. They intended to go along the edge of the forest, and round its northern end in the waste that lay \r\nbetween it and the beginning of the Grey Mountains. It was a long and cheerless road, but now that the \r\ngoblins were crushed, it seemed safer to them than the dreadful pathways under the trees. Moreover \r\nBeorn was going that way too. \r\n\r\n“Farewell! O Elvenking!” said Gandalf. “Merry be the greenwood, while the world is yet young! \r\nAnd merry be all your folk!” \r\n\r\n“Farewell! O Gandalf!” said the king. “May you ever appear where you are most needed and least \r\nexpected! The oftener you appear in my halls the better shall I be pleased!” \r\n\r\n“I beg of you,” said Bilbo stammering and standing on one foot, “to accept this gift!” and he \r\nbrought out a necklace of silver and pearls that Dain had given him at their parting. \r\n\r\n“In what way have I earned such a gift, O hobbit?” said the king. \r\n\r\n“Well, er, I thought, don’t you know,” said Bilbo rather confused, “that, er, some little return \r\nshould be made for your, er, hospitality. I mean even a burglar has his feelings. I have drunk much of \r\nyour wine and eaten much of your bread.” \r\n\r\n“I will take your gift, O Bilbo the Magnificent!” said the king gravely. “And I name you elf-friend \r\nand blessed. May your shadow never grow less (or stealing would be too easy)! Farewell!” \r\n\r\nThen the elves turned towards the Forest, and Bilbo started on his long road home. \r\n\r\n\r\nHe had many hardships and adventures before he got back. The Wild was still the Wild, and there \r\nwere many other things in it in those days beside goblins; but he was well guided and well guarded — \r\nthe wizard was with him, and Beorn for much of the way — and he was never in great danger again. \r\nAnyway by midwinter Gandalf and Bilbo had come all the way back, along both edges of the Forest, to \r\nthe doors of Beorn’ s house; and there for a while they both stayed. Yule-tide was warm and merry \r\nthere; and men came from far and wide to feast at Beorn’ s bidding. The goblins of the Misty \r\nMountains were now few and terrified, and hidden in the deepest holes they could find; and the Wargs \r\nhad vanished from the woods, so that men went abroad without fear. Beorn indeed became a great \r\nchief afterwards in those regions and ruled a wide land between the mountains and the wood; and it is \r\nsaid that for many generations the men of his line had the power of taking bear’s shape, and some \r\nwere grim men and bad, but most were in heart like Beorn, if less in size and strength. In their day the \r\nlast goblins were hunted from the Misty Mountains and a new peace came over the edge of the Wild. \r\n\r\nIt was spring, and a fair one with mild weathers and a bright sun, before Bilbo and Gandalf took \r\ntheir leave at last of Beorn, and though he longed for home, Bilbo left with regret, for the flowers of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe gardens of Beorn were in springtime no less marvellous than in high summer. \r\n\r\nAt last they came up the long road, and reached the very pass where the goblins had captured them \r\nbefore. But they came to that high point at morning, and looking backward they saw a white sun \r\nshining over the outstretched lands. There behind lay Mirkwood, blue in the distance, and darkly green \r\nat the nearer edge even in the spring. There far away was the Lonely Mountain on the edge of eyesight. \r\nOn its highest peak snow yet unmelted was gleaming pale. \r\n\r\n“So comes snow after fire, and even dragons have their ending!” said Bilbo, and he turned his back \r\non his adventure. The Tookish part was getting very tired, and the Baggins was daily getting stronger. \r\n“I wish now only to be in my own armchair!” he said."

    "ChapterName": " THE LAST STAGE ",
    "ChapterData": "It was on May the First that the two came back at last to the brink of the valley of Rivendell, where \r\nstood the Last (or the First) Homely House. Again it was evening, their ponies were tired, especially \r\nthe one that carried the baggage; and they all felt in need of rest. As they rode down the steep path, \r\nBilbo heard the elves still singing in the trees, as if they had not stopped since he left; and as soon as \r\nthe riders came down into the lower glades of the wood they burst into a song of much the same kind \r\nas before. This is something like it: \r\n\r\n\r\nThe dragon is withered, \r\n\r\nHis bones are now crumbled; \r\nHis armour is shivered, \r\n\r\nHis splendour is humbled! \r\nThough sword shall be rusted, \r\nAnd throne and crown perish \r\nWith strength that men trusted \r\nAnd wealth that they cherish, \r\nHere grass is still growing, \r\nAnd leaves are yet swinging, \r\nThe white water flowing, \r\n\r\nAnd elves are yet singing \r\n\r\nCome! Tra-la-la-lally! \r\n\r\nCome back to the valley! \r\n\r\n\r\nThe stars are far brighter \r\nThan gems without measure, \r\nThe moon is far whiter \r\nThan silver in treasure; \r\n\r\nThe fire is more shining \r\nOn hearth in the gloaming \r\nThan gold won by mining, \r\n\r\nSo why go a-roaming? \r\n\r\nO! Tra-la-la-lally \r\n\r\nCome back to the Valley. \r\n\r\n\r\nO! Where are you going, \r\nSo late in returning? \r\n\r\n\r\nThe river is flowing, \r\n\r\nThe stars are all burning! \r\nO! Whither so laden, \r\n\r\nSo sad and so dreary? \r\n\r\nHere elf and elf-maiden \r\nNow welcome the weary \r\nWith Tra-la-la-lally \r\nCome back to the Valley, \r\nTra-la-la-lally \r\nFa-la-la-lally \r\nFa-la! \r\n\r\n\r\nThen the elves of the valley came out and greeted them and led them across the water to the house \r\nof Elrond. There a warm welcome was made them, and there were many eager ears that evening to \r\nhear the tale of their adventures. Gandalf it was who spoke, for Bilbo was fallen quiet and drowsy. \r\nMost of the tale he knew, for he had been in it, and had himself told much of it to the wizard on their \r\nhomeward way or in the house of Beorn; but every now and again he would open one eye, and listen, \r\nwhen a part of the story which he did not yet know came in. \r\n\r\nIt was in this way that he learned where Gandalf had been to; for he overheard the words of the \r\nwizard to Elrond. It appeared that Gandalf had been to a great council of the white wizards, masters of \r\nlore and good magic; and that they had at last driven the Necromancer from his dark hold in the south \r\nof Mirkwood. \r\n\r\n“Ere long now,” Gandalf was saying, “the Forest will grow somewhat more wholesome. The North \r\nwill be freed from that horror for many long years, I hope. Yet I wish he were banished from the \r\nworld!” \r\n\r\n“It would be well indeed,” said Elrond; “but I fear that will not come about in this age of the world, \r\nor for many after.” \r\n\r\nWhen the tale of their journeyings was told, there were other tales, and yet more tales, tales of long \r\nago, and tales of new things, and tales of no time at all, till Bilbo’s head fell forward on his chest, and \r\nhe snored comfortably in a corner. \r\n\r\nHe woke to find himself in a white bed, and the moon shining through an open window. Below it \r\nmany elves were singing loud and clear on the banks of the stream. \r\n\r\n\r\nSing all ye joyful, now sing all together! \r\n\r\nThe wind’s in the tree-top, the wind’s in the heather; \r\nThe stars are in blossom, the moon is in flower, \r\n\r\nAnd bright are the windows of Night in her tower. \r\n\r\n\r\nDance all ye joyful, now dance all together! \r\nSoft is the grass, and let foot be like feather! \r\nThe river is silver, the shadows are fleeting; \r\nMerry is May-time, and merry our meeting. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSing we now softly, and dreams let us weave him! \r\n\r\nWind him in slumber and there let us leave him! \r\n\r\nThe wanderer sleepeth. Now soft be his pillow! Lullaby! \r\nLullaby! Alder and Willow! \r\n\r\n\r\nSigh no more Pine, till the wind of the morn! \r\nFall Moon! Dark be the land! \r\n\r\nHush! Hush! Oak, Ash, and Thorn! \r\nHushed be all water, till dawn is at hand! \r\n\r\n\r\n“Well, Merry People!” said Bilbo looking out. “What time by the moon is this? Your lullaby would \r\nwaken a drunken goblin! Yet I thank you.” \r\n\r\n“And your snores would waken a stone dragon — yet we thank you,” they answered with laughter. \r\n\r\n“It is drawing towards dawn, and you have slept now since the night’s beginning. Tomorrow, perhaps, \r\nyou will be cured of weariness.” \r\n\r\n“A little sleep does a great cure in the house of Elrond,” said he; “but I will take all the cure I can \r\nget. A second good night, fair friends!” And with that he went back to bed and slept till late morning. \r\n\r\nWeariness fell from him soon in that house, and he had many a merry jest and dance, early and \r\nlate, with the elves of the valley. Yet even that place could not long delay him now, and he thought \r\nalways of his own home. After a week, therefore, he said farewell to Elrond, and giving him such \r\nsmall gifts as he would accept, he rode away with Gandalf . \r\n\r\nEven as they left the valley the sky darkened in the West before them, and wind and rain came up \r\nto meet them. \r\n\r\n“Merry is May-time!” said Bilbo, as the rain beat into his face. “But our back is to legends and we \r\nare coming home. I suppose this is the first taste of it.” \r\n\r\n“There is a long road yet,” said Gandalf. \r\n\r\n“But it is the last road,” said Bilbo. \r\n\r\nThey came to the river that marked the very edge of the borderland of the Wild, and to the ford \r\nbeneath the steep bank, which you may remember. The water was swollen both with the melting of the \r\nsnows at the approach of summer, and with the daylong rain; but they crossed with some difficulty, \r\nand pressed forward, as evening fell, on the last stage of their journey. \r\n\r\nThis was much as it had been before, except that the company was smaller, and more silent; also \r\nthis time there were no trolls. At each point on the road Bilbo recalled the happenings and the words \r\nof a year ago — it seemed to him more like ten — so that, of course, he quickly noted the place where \r\nthe pony had fallen in the river, and they had turned aside for their nasty adventure with Tom and Bert \r\nand Bill. \r\n\r\nNot far from the road they found the gold of the trolls, which they had buried, still hidden and \r\nuntouched. “I have enough to last me my time,” said Bilbo, when they had dug it up. “You had better \r\ntake this, Gandalf. I daresay you can find a use for it.” \r\n\r\n“Indeed I can!” said the wizard. “But share and share alike! You may find you have more needs \r\nthan you expect.” \r\n\r\nSo they put the gold in bags and slung them on the ponies, who were not at all pleased about it. \r\nAfter that their going was slower, for most of the time they walked. But the land was green and there \r\nwas much grass through which the hobbit strolled along contentedly. He mopped his face with a red \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsilk handkerchief — no! not a single one of his own had survived, he had borrowed this one from \r\nElrond — for now June had brought summer, and the weather was bright and hot again. \r\n\r\nAs all things come to an end, even this story, a day came at last when they were in sight of the \r\ncountry where Bilbo had been born and bred, where the shapes of the land and of the trees were as well \r\nknown to him as his hands and toes. Coming to a rise he could see his own Hill in the distance, and he \r\nstopped suddenly and said: \r\n\r\n\r\nRoads go ever ever on, \r\n\r\nOver rock and under tree, \r\n\r\nBy caves where never sun has shone, \r\n\r\nBy streams that never find the sea; \r\nOver snow by winter sown, \r\n\r\nAnd through the merry flowers of June, \r\nOver grass and over stone, \r\n\r\nAnd under mountains in the moon. \r\n\r\n\r\nRoads go ever ever on \r\n\r\nUnder cloud and under star, \r\n\r\nYet feet that wandering have gone \r\nTurn at last to home afar. \r\n\r\nEyes that fire and sword have seen \r\nAnd horror in the halls of stone \r\nLook at last on meadows green \r\n\r\nAnd trees and hills they long have known. \r\n\r\n\r\nGandalf looked at him. “My dear Bilbo!” he said. “Something is the matter with you! You are not \r\nthe hobbit that you were.” \r\n\r\nAnd so they crossed the bridge and passed the mill by the river and came right back to Bilbo’s own \r\ndoor. \r\n\r\n“Bless me! What’s going on?” he cried. There was a great commotion, and people of all sorts, \r\nrespectable and unrespectable, were thick round the door, and many were going in and out — not even \r\nwiping their feet on the mat, as Bilbo noticed with annoyance. \r\n\r\nIf he was surprised, they were more surprised still. He had arrived back in the middle of an \r\nauction! There was a large notice in black and red hung on the gate, stating that on June the Twenty- \r\nsecond Messrs Grubb, Grubb, and Burrowes would sell by auction the effects of the late Bilbo Baggins \r\nEsquire, of Bag-End, Underhill, Hobbiton. Sale to commence at ten o’clock sharp. It was now nearly \r\nlunchtime, and most of the things had already been sold, for various prices from next to nothing to old \r\nsongs (as is not unusual at auctions). Bilbo’s cousins the Sackville-Bagginses were, in fact, busy \r\nmeasuring his rooms to see if their own furniture would fit. In short Bilbo was “Presumed Dead”, and \r\nnot everybody that said so was sorry to find the presumption wrong. \r\n\r\nThe return of Mr. Bilbo Baggins created quite a disturbance, both under the Hill and over the Hill, \r\nand across the Water; it was a great deal more than a nine days’ wonder. The legal bother, indeed, \r\nlasted for years. It was quite a long time before Mr. Baggins was in fact admitted to be alive again. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people who had got specially good bargains at the Sale took a deal of convincing; and in the end \r\nto save time Bilbo had to buy back quite a lot of his own furniture. Many of his silver spoons \r\nmysteriously disappeared and were never accounted for. Personally he suspected the Sackville- \r\nBagginses. On their side they never admitted that the returned Baggins was genuine, and they were not \r\non friendly terms with Bilbo ever after. They really had wanted to live in his nice hobbit-hole so very \r\nmuch. \r\n\r\nIndeed Bilbo found he had lost more than spoons — he had lost his reputation. It is true that for ever \r\nafter he remained an elf-friend, and had the honour of dwarves, wizards, and all such folk as ever \r\npassed that way; but he was no longer quite respectable. He was in fact held by all the hobbits of the \r\nneighbourhood to be 'queer 5 — except by his nephews and nieces on the Took side, but even they were \r\nnot encouraged in their friendship by their elders. \r\n\r\nI am sorry to say he did not mind. He was quite content; and the sound of the kettle on his hearth \r\nwas ever after more musical than it had been even in the quiet days before the Unexpected Party. His \r\nsword he hung over the mantelpiece. His coat of mail was arranged on a stand in the hall (until he lent \r\nit to a Museum). His gold and silver was largely spent in presents, both useful and extravagant — \r\nwhich to a certain extent accounts for the affection of his nephews and his nieces. His magic ring he \r\nkept a great secret, for he chiefly used it when unpleasant callers came. \r\n\r\nHe took to writing poetry and visiting the elves; and though many shook their heads and touched \r\ntheir foreheads and said “Poor old Baggins!” and though few believed any of his tales, he remained \r\nvery happy to the end of his days, and those were extraordinarily long. \r\n\r\n\r\nOne autumn evening some years afterwards Bilbo was sitting in his study writing his memoirs — he \r\nthought of calling them “There and Back Again, a Hobbit’s Holiday” — when there was a ring at the \r\ndoor. It was Gandalf and a dwarf; and the dwarf was actually Balin. \r\n\r\n“Come in! Come in!” said Bilbo, and soon they were settled in chairs by the fire. If Balin noticed \r\nthat Mr. Baggins’ waistcoat was more extensive (and had real gold buttons), Bilbo also noticed that \r\nBalin’ s beard was several inches longer, and his jewelled belt was of great magnificence. \r\n\r\nThey fell to talking of their times together, of course, and Bilbo asked how things were going in the \r\nlands of the Mountain. It seemed they were going very well. Bard had rebuilt the town in Dale and \r\nmen had gathered to him from the Lake and from South and West, and all the valley had become tilled \r\nagain and rich, and the desolation was now filled with birds and blossoms in spring and fruit and \r\nfeasting in autumn. And Lake-town was refounded and was more prosperous than ever, and much \r\nwealth went up and down the Running River; and there was friendship in those parts between elves \r\nand dwarves and men. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople, but being of the kind that easily catches such disease he fell under the dragon-sickness, and \r\ntook most of the gold and fled with it, and died of starvation in the Waste, deserted by his \r\ncompanions. \r\n\r\n“The new Master is of wiser kind,” said Balin, “and very popular, for, of course, he gets most of \r\nthe credit for the present prosperity. They are making songs which say that in his day the rivers run \r\nwith gold.” \r\n\r\n“Then the prophecies of the old songs have turned out to be true, after a fashion!” said Bilbo. \r\n\r\n“Of course!” said Gandalf. “And why should not they prove true? Surely you don’t disbelieve the \r\nprophecies, because you had a hand in bringing them about yourself? You don’t really suppose, do \r\nyou, that all your adventures and escapes were managed by mere luck, just for your sole bene-fit? You \r\nare a very fine person, Mr. Baggins, and I am very fond of you; but you are only quite a little fellow in \r\na wide world after all!” \r\n\r\n“Thank goodness!” said Bilbo laughing, and handed him the tobacco-jar."
